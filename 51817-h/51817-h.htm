<h4 class="left"><i>Using This Handbook</i></h4>
<p>The major attractions at Big Bend National Park in
west Texas are the Rio Grande and its canyons, the
Chisos Mountains, and the Chihuahuan Desert.
Part 1 of the handbook gives a brief introduction to the
park and its history; Part 2 takes a close look at the
area&rsquo;s natural history; and Part 3 presents concise
travel guide and reference materials.</p>
<p>National Park Handbooks, compact introductions
to the great natural and historic places administered
by the National Park Service, are published to support
the National Park Service&rsquo;s management programs
at the parks and to promote understanding
and enjoyment of the parks. Each is intended to be
informative reading and a useful guide before,
during, and after a park visit. More than 100 titles
are in print. This is Handbook 119. You may purchase
the handbooks through the mail by writing
to Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government
Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.</p>

<p class="pcap">Indians held that after making the Earth
the Great Spirit dumped leftover rocks on the Big Bend.
&ldquo;The unknown land,&rdquo; Spanish explorers labeled it. Its mythic
topography inspired quests for lost mines and instant wealth
in gold and silver. A rainbow over Cerro Castellan implies
its own pot of gold.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h3 id="c2">Where Rainbows Wait for Rain</h3>
<p>Far down on the Mexican border the Rio Grande
makes a great U-turn. Inside this mighty curve lies a
national park and the special and spectacular section
of southwest Texas known as &ldquo;Big Bend Country.&rdquo;
More than a century ago a Mexican cowboy
described Big Bend as &ldquo;Where the rainbows wait for
the rain, and the big river is kept in a stone box, and
water runs uphill and mountains float in the air,
except at night when they go away to play with other
mountains....&rdquo; This land is so vast and so wild that
you can feel your human smallness and frailty.
Silence takes on the quality of sound, and isolation
can bring you face to face with the interdependence
of all life forms.</p>
<p>Paradox abounds. There is killing heat and freezing
cold; deadly drought and flash flood; arid lowland
and moist mountain woodland; and a living
river winding its way across the desert.</p>
<p>Spanish explorers called Big Bend the &ldquo;unknown
land,&rdquo; and for hundreds of years civilization passed it
by on either side. Entrenched behind deep river
canyons and walled in by rough and rugged mountains,
this vast country remains today a world apart.
Fewer than 13,000 people occupy an area about the
size of Maryland, mostly in two or three towns
strung along the highway to the north. Only three
paved roads run south into Big Bend, and whatever
route you take, you&rsquo;ll find yourself in country that
looks less and less familiar the farther you penetrate
it. Here are the landscapes, plants, and animals
typical of the Chihuahuan Desert, a high dry wilderness
that spills northward out of Mexico into far west
Texas and southern New Mexico.</p>
<p>Basically, Big Bend&rsquo;s desert is a rolling land of
creosotebush and bunch grass. But it grows gorgeous
forests of giant yucca and solid stands of lechuguilla,
a barbed and bladed plant found only in the Chihuahuan
Desert. Big Bend&rsquo;s desert has living sand
dunes, painted badlands, and petrified trees, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
since it is a geologically young desert, its landforms
stand in rugged relief. Igneous dikes march across
plain and mountain like so many man-made stone
walls. Chimney-tall stacks thrust up from barren flats
as from a ruin. Volcanic ash heaps, white as snow,
lean their concrete shoulders against maroon hills.</p>
<p>The Indians used to say that after making the
Earth, the Great Spirit dumped the leftover rocks on
Big Bend. Heaped up, scattered wide, and piled into
mountains, they lie here to this day. Since vegetation
is so scant, Big Bend mountains take their shape and
color from the rocks of which they are made. They
loom castellated, cathedral-domed, flattopped, and
razor-backed. They look red, yellow, gray, black,
white, and all the shades of brown, empurpled by
distance or misted over after rain in a gauzy film of
green. You don&rsquo;t know which is more awe-inspiring,
looking up or looking down, since the mountains
rise with striking suddenness between the vaulted
sky and the open plain. Approaching the Chisos
Mountains for the first time, you can&rsquo;t believe that
cars can breach those bastions, or that high inside
there actually is a Basin where travelers have
camped since people first gazed on these mountains.
Undulating foothills fling themselves like breakers
against the sheer rock cliffs. Standing atop the
escarpment that walls up the Chisos South Rim, you
see hills and mountains rolling like ocean waves far,
far below, with here and there a gleam of silver
where the river runs.</p>
<p>Big Bend&rsquo;s Rio Grande takes its moods from the
weather, the season, the time of day, and the changing
nature of its bed and banks. The river runs lavender-rose
at sunset, brown between frost-reddened
shrubs, shining like a tin roof under hazy skies, white
as chopped ice where rapids churn, olive-green beneath
the brooding cliffs of Old Mexico. Nobody
knows which came first, the mountains or a through-flowing
river, but for hundreds of river kilometers
the Rio dodges and doubles, and where it cannot go
around it rasps its way across the mountains. Deep-cut
canyons alternate with narrow valleys walled in
by towering cliffs. You can&rsquo;t get across except at a
handful of fords, or up steep trails at favorable stages
of water. These canyons and escarpments lend Big
Bend its monumental character, for as it digs, the
river lays bare millions of years of Earth history. To
run a desert river canyon is to penetrate the long,
tortuous corridor from everlasting to everlasting:
Time is here turned to stone. Imprisoned, yet wild
and free, the Rio runs the ages down inside a
rock-ribbed vault.</p>

<p>Human beings have lived in the Big Bend area for
ten to twelve thousand years. The first to come were
probably nomadic hunters following the big game
that drifted south ahead of the last great continental
ice sheet. They hunted elephant, camel, bison,
pronghorn, and horses, as indicated by their kill sites
discovered in the mesa and Pecos River country to
the north and east of the park. But as the Earth
warmed up and glaciers melted, a deadly dryness
crept eastward from Mexico&rsquo;s Sierra Madre Occidental
and engulfed Big Bend. Moisture-loving plants
died out or were driven out by drought-resistant
species, and as the climate and vegetation changed,
so did the animals. Many Ice Age mammals perished
forever and the hunters themselves seem to have
disappeared.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the next people to infiltrate Big
Bend were nomadic Indians adapted to desert life.
Theirs was a follow-the-food economy, and they
camped in caves and rock shelters close to such
water sources as the Rio Grande and its tributaries,
springs, and rock wells. They hunted desert animals
for meat and skins, ate juniper berries, pricklypears,
century plant hearts, yucca blossoms, and mesquite
beans. They made baskets, nets, mats, and sandals
from basketgrass and the long slim leaves of the
yucca. Today, thousands of years later, remnants of
these may still be found in dry caves. These prehistoric
nomads also disappeared, perhaps killed or
absorbed by the Jumanos, a semi-pueblo people who
came to occupy the river valleys west of the park.</p>
<p>Cabeza de Vaca and his companions are thought
to have been the first Spaniards to reach Big Bend.
In 1535 they were astonished to find a farming
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
people&mdash;probably the Jumanos at Presidio&mdash;living in
actual houses at the junction of two rivers. Many
years were to pass before the <i>conquistadores</i> scouted
this far country. Driven by their lust for gold and
silver and zealous to Christianize the Indians, the
Spaniards ignored Big Bend because they thought
this unpeopled desert held no riches. The only
Indians then living in the park were the Chisos, a
tribe from north central Mexico that passed its
summers in the mountains north of the Rio Grande.
The Spaniards had the habit of enslaving Indians to
work their mines, and the Chisos retaliated by
coming down from Big Bend to raid the Spaniards. In
1644 the Chisos won a great victory, but in the end,
they were driven out by a new group of Indians who
filtered down the Rio Grande from New Mexico.
These were the Mescalero Apaches, so-called because
they ate the heart of the &ldquo;mescal&rdquo; or century
plant. So fierce and skilled in battle were they that
even the Spaniards fled before them. By 1720 they
dominated Big Bend, becoming known as Chisos
Apaches. Regarding themselves as mountain folk,
the Apaches became the most successful desert
dwellers and guerrilla fighters this country has ever
known. What nature did not provide they took by
raiding. Belatedly the Spaniards tried to stop the
raids by building forts near major Rio Grande fords.
One of these, a combination mission and presidio,
was built about 1770 on the Mexican side at the
park&rsquo;s San Vicente crossing. But the Apaches kept
up the pressure, the Spaniards fled, and the fort soon
lay in decay.</p>

</div>
<p>About this same time a new group of raiders, the
Comanches, appeared in Big Bend. These nomadic
buffalo hunters may have been the finest horsemen
the world has ever seen. They ruled the south plains
from Oklahoma to Texas and used Big Bend as a
highroad to Mexico. For more than a hundred years,
at the full of the September moon, the painted
warriors crossed the Pecos and swept down past the
flattopped hills and on up the long, empty, gently
sloping desert floor toward the blue mountains,
threading the Santiagos at Persimmon Gap where
U.S. 385 now enters the park. They forded the Rio
Grande at present-day Lajitas, picked Mexico clean
as far south as Durango, and turned home at the
end of the year. Driving captives and herds of horses
and cattle northward, they probably recrossed the
Rio at Paso de Chisos just to the west of Mariscal
Canyon. We are told that for decades after the last
Comanche left Big Bend, the great War Trail burned
like a white scar across the landscape, scuffed bare
by countless hooves.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Anglo-Americans took no interest in Big Bend
until the Mexican War of 1848 fixed the border along
the Rio Grande. In the 1850s, two U.S. Boundary
Survey teams traveled downriver by boat and mule
train, and their published reports give the first
scientific look at Big Bend country and its plants and
wildlife. But for the next quarter-century Big Bend
belonged to the Indians, and to the U.S. troopers
who pushed endless patrols across its everlasting
wilderness, facing sun, thirst, alkali dust, danger, and
sometimes death, for $13 a month. The Mescaleros
knew the country. They knew how to use its mountains,
caves, canyons, and arroyos, and where to find
water, wood, grass, and game. But tracked at last
into their most secret and remote retreats, nothing
remained for them but the reservation. As for the
Chisos Apaches, they were tricked into Mexico by a
promise of asylum, only to be captured and killed or
dispersed across Mexico.</p>
<p>Although Big Bend Indians had long used cinnabar
red in their war paint and rock paintings, not
until the end of the last century did commercial mining
of cinnabar ore begin. To look at the ruins of
Terlingua and Study Butte today, it is hard to imagine
that 2,000 souls lived and worked just west of the
park. Yet the Chisos Mining Company was once the
world&rsquo;s second largest quicksilver mine, producing
100,000 flasks of mercury between 1900 and 1941.
The park&rsquo;s own Mariscal Mine had a relatively short
life and never really made money. All of the mines
finally succumbed when the rich ore veins played
out and the price of quicksilver fell. Similar fates
overtook the copper, zinc, and lead mines that drew
a couple thousand people to both sides of the river
near present-day Boquillas. These mines were located
in Mexico&rsquo;s Sierra del Carmen and the ore
crossed the river to the U.S. side via a steam-driven
aerial tramway. Mule-drawn wagons and trucks then
hauled it over the Old Ore Road to railhead at
Marathon 160 kilometers (100 miles) away.</p>

Mountains loom as an island

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>To feed the miners, Anglos and Mexicans set up
irrigated farms near Boquillas, along Castolon valley,
and at Terlingua Abaja. These activities took
an enormous toll on Big Bend&rsquo;s natural resources.
Woodsmen scoured the country far and wide for
timber for buildings and for firing mine furnaces.
Ore train mules fed heavily on the chino grama
grass. And when the mines failed and the farmers
abandoned their fields, they left the land so bare that
much time went by before the desert shrubs began
taking over.</p>
<p>Ranching did not really come to Big Bend until
after the Indian Wars. But once surveying parties
began to locate and survey sections, cattle, sheep,
goats, and horses came by trail and rail to feed upon
the virgin grasslands. First-comers took up lands
with permanent water; from the earliest days ranchmen
headquartered at Oak Spring in the Chisos.
Later arrivals had to dig wells and install windmills
as Sam Nail did at the Old Ranch. The 1930s saw the
end of &ldquo;open range&rdquo; ranching, and fencing became
a prime concern for such ranchers as the Burnhams
at Government Spring and Homer Wilson in the
Chisos. Other ever-present problems involved water
resources, drought, livestock losses from disease and
predators, and remoteness from markets, schools,
and doctors. Most ranchers understood the land and
many loved it. They used their pastures to capacity,
but they did not overstock the range until the 1940s.
Then, just before the national park came into being,
ruinous overgrazing all but wiped out the grasslands.</p>
<p>Today, Big Bend National Park sprawls across
3,205 square kilometers (1,252 square miles) inside
the southernmost tip of the Bend. Even with interstate
highways, park headquarters is a long way off.
It is 660 kilometers (410 miles) from San Antonio to
Panther Junction, 520 kilometers (323 miles) from El
Paso, 173 kilometers (108 miles) from Alpine&rsquo;s meals
and motels, 110 kilometers (68 miles) from the last
community, Marathon. But the journey is well worth
the effort, because the park preserves some of the nation&rsquo;s
most dramatic land forms and rarest life forms.</p>
<p>The main body of the park is a great 65-kilometer
(40-mile) wide trough or &ldquo;sunken block&rdquo; that began
to subside millions of years ago, when Mesa de
Anguila and Sierra del Carmen cracked off and
slowly tilted up to the west and east. The Rio
Grande draws the park&rsquo;s southern boundary, slicing
through three mountain ranges to form Santa Elena,
Mariscal, and Boquillas Canyons. And right in the
middle of the sunken block, rising higher than all the
other mountains, the Chisos hang above the desert
like a blue mirage.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>What makes a desert, of course, is scanty precipitation.
And because of the great range in altitude&mdash;from
550 meters (1,800 feet) along the river to 2,400
meters (7,800 feet) atop the Chisos&mdash;there is a wide
variation in available moisture and in temperature
throughout the park. This has produced an exceptional
diversity in plant and animal habitats. Receiving
less than 25 centimeters (10 inches) of rainfall in
a year, almost half the park is shrub desert. This
plant community begins right next to the river and
runs on up to about 1,050 meters (3,500 feet).
Another 49 percent of the park is desert grassland, a
somewhat less dry environment that you will encounter
on mesa tops and foothills to about 1,700
meters (5,500 feet). From there on up, mountain
canyons and slopes may sustain typical southwestern
woodlands with pinyons, junipers, and oak trees.
The Chisos heights receive some 46 centimeters (18
inches) of rain per year and are considerably cooler
than the desert. Consequently you will even find 325
hectares (800 acres) of forest in two or three high
canyons, where towering Rocky Mountain-type trees
persist from cooler, moister times. And that is not
all: A lush green jungle grows in a narrow belt along
each bank of the Rio Grande and pushes out across
the desert along creeks and arroyos. And in the river
itself live creatures you wouldn&rsquo;t expect to find in
the middle of the desert!</p>
<p>Big Bend National Park is home to more than 70
species of mammals, almost as many species of
reptiles and amphibians, a score or more fishes, and
a fascinating host of insects and other arthropods.
The wide choice of habitats makes Big Bend a
birder&rsquo;s paradise that offers more different resident
and migrant birds than any other U.S. national park.
Thanks to its location, the park marks the southernmost
reach of some U.S. plant and animal species,
and the northernmost reach of some Mexican
species. Some plants and animals found here occur
nowhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1944, the national park
has developed programs and facilities in line with its
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
two-fold purpose of preserving and protecting natural
and historic values while also enriching the lives
of its visitors. Santa Elena Canyon and historic
Castolon form an important sight-seeing area in the
southwestern corner of the park, and the road from
Panther Junction to Santa Elena is probably the
most scenic in the park. The Basin lies in the heart of
the Chisos Mountains. This beautiful valley has
complete motel, dining, and camping facilities, and
an amphitheater where park naturalists give evening
programs. The Rio Grande Village-Boquillas area
on the southeast side of the park offers delightful
camping, a visit to the nearby Mexican village of
Boquillas, and a view of Boquillas Canyon&rsquo;s magnificent
portal. More than 175 kilometers (110 miles) of
paved park roads link major sites and well-kept
hiking, horse, and nature trails will take you to other
spectacular areas. For properly equipped desert
buffs, primitive backcountry roads and trails offer
exciting opportunities for true wilderness adventure.</p>
<p>But whether you come to the park for a weekend
or a week, for vistas and views, or for a close-up look
at nature and its mysteries, you will find that Big
Bend is more than the sum of its parts. When the
setting sun paints the Sierra del Carmen red and blue
and purple, you feel both Big Bend&rsquo;s unity with all
Earth processes and its wonderful uniqueness. In
those many-colored cliffs hung above the desert, you
see rainbows waiting ripe with promise for the
miracle of rain.</p>

<h3 id="c4">A World of Difference</h3>
<p>Stand on the bald knob of Emory Peak and you&rsquo;ll see
the Chihuahuan Desert rolled out below you with
wave upon wave of mesas and mountains reaching
out to the rim of the world. You can see for
hundreds of kilometers in all directions. Not a house,
not another human being, no living thing moves. Big
Bend looks round, complete, as timeless and permanent
as planet Earth itself and as beautiful and
barren as the Moon. But Big Bend isn&rsquo;t just one
world, and it isn&rsquo;t lifeless. It is many different worlds
inhabited by countless creatures both great and
small pursuing an extraordinary variety of lifestyles.
These worlds may be as narrow as the mosquitofish&rsquo;s
spring-fed pool, as wide as the cougar&rsquo;s hunting
range, as dry as the pocket mouse&rsquo;s burrow, as wet as
the beaver&rsquo;s pond, as open as the mule deer&rsquo;s golden
grassland, or as canopied as the Colima warbler&rsquo;s
forested canyon.</p>
<p>And the Big Bend world is not as changeless as it
seems. Over an unthinkably long span of geologic
time, and sometimes overnight, Big Bend has experienced
sweeping changes that carried off whole
communities of plants and animals. The great order
of dinosaurs died out, and no one knows why, yet the
scorpion and turtle have lived on here virtually
unchanged through countless ages. Other plants and
animals have staked survival on the long, slow
process of adaptation to a changing environment.
While one ancient lily evolved into grass, for example,
another became the giant dagger we see today.
Cholla cactus shades itself with thorns and the
kangaroo rat manages never to take a drink.</p>
<p>In Big Bend as elsewhere, what animals live where
is largely determined by what plants grow where.
This in turn depends on such variables as the type
and condition of the soil, elevation, climate, temperature,
humidity, amount of cloud cover and direct
sunlight, exposure to the wind, availability of water,
and the drastic changes for bad and for good wrought
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
by man. Yet there is nothing clear-cut or fixed about
the edges of the different plant communities. The
floodplain goes green or returns to dust depending
on the river&rsquo;s rise or fall. The shrub desert, the
grasslands, and the woodlands all crawl uphill or
down, putting out skirmishers along their lines of
march. Within the national park natural forces are
once again free to shape and reshape Big Bend&rsquo;s
different worlds. The battle seesaws back and forth
between drought and ponderosa pine, tarbush and
tabosa-grass, the eater and the eaten, the river and
the rock, and the sun and the ageless land.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/img014.jpg" alt="" width="372" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Broadly speaking there are
four North American deserts:
the Great Basin, Mohave,
Sonoran, and Chihuahuan.
The park lies within the
Chihuahuan. This desert is
bordered on three sides by
mountains; the fourth abuts
vast semi-arid plains. The
Sierra Madre Oriental (East
Mother Range) blocks winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, except
as spinoffs of summer
hurricanes. The Sierra Madre
Occidental (West Mother
Range) blocks the westerlies.
How can you recognize Chihuahuan
Desert? By the
lechuguilla plant (see <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>),
which grows only in this
desert.</p>
</div>
<p>In Big Bend you can turn back your personal
clock to a time when mankind was still very obviously
part of nature. You can walk in the desert and
drink solitude as sweet as spring water or sit on the
edge of a mountain meadow knee-deep in grass. You
can watch the whitetail deer drift through the forest
in a silence as perfect and ethereal as song, watching
you but expressing no fear. For in the park you are
just one more of nature&rsquo;s creatures free to live and to
grow in Big Bend&rsquo;s self-healing, life-renewing world.</p>
<p>For many people the spirit of the desert is embodied
in the vulture tirelessly circling empty skies
above a bleak and barren land, the harvester of
death keeping watch over desolation. But the desert
is far from lifeless or the vulture wouldn&rsquo;t be on
patrol. The meager shrubs are miracles of adaptation
and those seeming barren wastes rustle under
the feet of countless busy creatures. Across the eons
evolutionary selection has produced a different design
for living within each species, yet all are subject
to the same law.</p>
<p>Heat and aridity are the chief factors controlling
all Chihuahuan Desert life. Most desert creatures
stay in hiding during the day, keeping out of the sun
in underground burrows, under rocks, or in the
shrubs&rsquo; sparse shade. Many birds and most larger
mammals don&rsquo;t even visit the desert during the heat
of the day. And although plants cannot crawl out
from under the sun, nature has protected them by
different means.</p>
<p>Probably the best way to see the living desert is to
get out and walk and look. Study a plot of shrub
desert in a single day and night. The most obvious
desert dwellers, and sometimes the only living things
you will see, are the plants. These vary from one
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
stretch of desert to another because different species
prefer different living conditions. But you will likely
find plants in several categories, including woody
and fibrous shrubs, cactuses, and other succulents.
All have their own ways of resisting heat and drought,
and all provide food or shelter to one or another
special animal.</p>
<p>If success can be judged by sheer numbers, then
the most successful desert shrub must be creosotebush,
an evergreen bush that can make a living on
the poorest and driest soils. You cannot mistake it
for any other. The ground around it is apt to be bare
and the individual bushes so evenly spaced that they
look hand planted. This characteristic creosotebush
pattern is probably caused by root competition for
scant moisture. Each creosotebush has a long taproot
reaching down maybe 9 meters (30 feet) to find
underground water, while a network of shallow roots
spreads far and wide to capture every drop of
surface moisture. The plant protects itself from
moisture loss by giving its dark green leaves a
light-reflecting coat of resin. In the springtime, and
often after rain, it bursts into brief yellow flower. It
fruits in fuzzy little white balls, and you sometimes
see a plant bearing both fruits and flowers.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the creosotebush, its taste is so
unpleasant that few large animals care to eat it. But
the little creosotebush grasshopper spends his whole
life living and nibbling on the shrub. You&rsquo;ll hear him
chirping away in a creosotebush, but unless he jumps
you may never find him. He&rsquo;s a great ventriloquist
who across countless generations has evolved protective
coloring, the same dark green as creosote
leaves, marked with the same red and white of its
little stems and fruits. You may never see the mottled
gray and black walking-stick insect either, who sticks
his front legs straight out in front of him to look
exactly like a woody creosotebush twig. Creosotebush
holds the desert soil as blowing sands heap
hummocks around its stems, and these make favorite
burrowing sites for all sorts of little desert rodents
and reptiles. Look under almost any creosotebush,
and you will see their holes. You may even see a
busy line of ants taking bits of creosote leaf and fruit
to an underground nest.</p>

red flower clusters. The ocotillo
is common throughout
both the Chihuahuan and
Sonoran Deserts.</p>
</div>
<p>Another curious woody shrub resembles a sheaf of
coachwhips. If you see ocotillo after rain, it will look
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
like a green fountain. If you see it during a dry spell,
you may think it is dead. Not so. Ocotillo puts on a
fresh close-fitting suit of green leaves whenever it
rains. Then as soil and air dry out, it sheds its leaves
right down to the bare brown stems. This cuts back
on the plant&rsquo;s water needs. Moisture loss is further
reduced by resinous cells that form the inner bark.
In springtime the tip of each ocotillo wand burns
with a cluster of scarlet flowers.</p>
<p>Cactuses have done away with leaves altogether,
thus reducing their surface area and cutting down on
moisture loss. Although they look dry and forbidding,
inside that harsh exterior their flesh is moist
and succulent. The food-making function has been
taken over by the thick, green, wax-covered stems.
And since the stems are also used to store water,
they have ballooned into a weird and wonderful assortment
of shapes and sizes. You&rsquo;ll find the mound-building
strawberry cactus with its mass of finger-like
heads, the Texas rainbow cactus with its small group
of cylindrical heads topped by bright yellow flowers,
the tuber-like living rock, the dog and cane cholla,
and the great sprawling pricklypear that lifts its
beavertails from desert flat to mountaintop.</p>
<p>Cactuses come heavily armed with spines so cleverly
shaped that they are called &ldquo;fish-hook,&rdquo; &ldquo;eagle&rsquo;s
claw,&rdquo; and &ldquo;horse crippler.&rdquo; These spines serve a
double purpose: By building a lattice work around
the stem of a cactus they shade it from the sun, and
in many cases they make the cactus too prickly for
animals to eat. Some animals have learned to use
cactus spines for their own protection. The big,
ratchet-voiced cactus wren likes to build its nest in
the densely spined cholla, and the packrat often
piles pricklypear pads in its nest area.</p>
<p>Pricklypear is the commonest cactus in the park
and also the easiest to identify. Purple-tinged pricklypear
is just what its name suggests, and so is the
brown-spine pricklypear. Blind pricklypear looks as
if it has no thorns, but if you touch one of the velvety
buttons on a pad, you will pick up a fingerful of
almost invisible, but highly irritating little spines.
Engelmann pricklypear is the most abundant species.
And to human taste its fruits are delicious,
although the tiny glochids, barbed spines, can hurt
the mouth. Many desert creatures eat pricklypear:
Flies, bees, and butterflies come to feast at the
showy blossoms; birds, coyotes, peccaries, and deer
eat the reddish fruits; small rodents reach between
the spines to nibble on the juicy pads. In times of
drought ranchers burn off the spines and feed the
pads to cattle. And people lost in the desert can do
as the Indians did&mdash;peel, cut, or roast the skin off the
pads and the flesh yields both food and moisture.
Some pricklypears are too bitter to eat, however.</p>

</div>
<p>One of the most interesting plants in the Chihuahuan
Desert is a sturdy bunch of blades called
lechuguilla. This fiercely spined agave lives nowhere
else in the world. When Cabeza de Vaca crossed Big
Bend in 1535, the lechuguilla grew so thick that he
didn&rsquo;t dare walk at night. Today you find it growing
singly or in colonies from the shrub desert clear up
into the Chisos woodlands, its needle points still
menacing hikers, horses, and deer.</p>
<p>Lechuguilla is a fiber plant that keeps its juicy
parts underground until it blooms, which it does only
once a lifetime, after ten to fifteen years. The bloom
stalk shoots up like a giant asparagus spear maybe
four meters (15 feet) tall, flowering from the bottom
up in close-packed purplish or yellowish blooms.
Then the whole plant perishes by degrees. You may
find a lechuguilla whose blades have died and dried
while the bloomstalk is still moist and green. Eventually
the bloomstalk, too, will turn into wood strong
enough for a deer to lean against when rubbing
velvet from his antlers.</p>
<p>Lechuguilla reproduces both by seeds and by
rhizomes, and you sometimes find tiny new rosettes
breaking ground on the runners of a mature plant.
Peccaries often root up the juicy lechuguilla rhizomes,
while mule deer relish the tender bloomstalk,
munching it much as a cow chews a stalk of corn.
Pocket gophers eat the core right out of a standing
plant by tunneling underground.</p>
<p>The kinds of animals you meet in the desert will
differ with the time of day and the time of year. They
must find food and moisture, mate, and raise their
young without exposing themselves to killing heat
and the risk of dehydration. Insects, spiders, scorpions,
and reptiles all derive their body temperature
from their surroundings. This is why they stiffen up
to the point of helplessness when it&rsquo;s cold, and why
crawling on a super-hot surface will kill them in
short order. Their temperature regulation problems
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
are compounded by conditions in the desert, and
most of them cope by modifying their behavior.</p>
<p>In the early morning you may see grasshoppers
sunning themselves on a rock as rattlesnakes will do.
They line up broadside to the sun&rsquo;s rays, raising their
wings and lowering their legs to expose their abdomens
directly to the sun&rsquo;s warmth. By noonday they
line up parallel to the sun&rsquo;s rays to minimize heat
absorption, and they will seek shade. Also, instead of
hopping over the ground, many Big Bend grasshoppers
live in and fly from bush to bush. The surface of
the desert may be 20 to 25 degrees Celsius (40 to
50&deg;F) hotter than is the air just over a meter (4 feet)
above the ground. This is why in the daytime you
will mostly see only flying insects, such as butterflies,
grasshoppers, true bugs, true flies, and bees, and
why so many crawling insects stay hidden during the
heat of the day. However, there are some curious
exceptions: The darkling beetle scurries about over
the sand throughout the day. An air-filled space
under its hard outer wing-covers acts as a kind of
insulation between the back and abdomen. Some
darkling beetles also raise the abdomen at an angle
of about 45 degrees. Speed is of the essence for this
little scavenger as it scurries from cover to shade.</p>
<p>Some grasshoppers are ground dwellers that have
lived on the desert pavement so long that they even
look like stones. Many come in conventional grasshopper
shape but are mottled in shades of gray and
mauve. The toadhopper that inhabits wash bottoms
and rocky areas has taken on the color, shape, and
texture of rock. Fat and squatty, he will camouflage
himself, tucking his antenna right down in front of
his face and pulling his legs in close to his body. You
can&rsquo;t even see him when you know he is there. By
comparison, the lubber grasshopper advertises his
presence. He is a large black beast gaudily marked in
coral-snake red and yellow. Apparently these colors
warn predators that the lubber is distasteful. He is
out and about from late morning on.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/img016d.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="442" />
<p class="pcap">Whiptail scorpions, which are not
true scorpions, have no stinger. They pursue insects
and other invertebrates and kill them with powerful pincers.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/img016e.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="436" />
<p class="pcap">Eleven species of stinging scorpions live in the
park. Coloration varies from dull-cream through brown to
shiny black.</p>
</div>
<p>Also seen in broad daylight is the worm-like millipede
rippling its way across the desert pavement.
This maroon-colored plant eater has up to 200 legs
arranged in short double pairs along a 13-centimeter
(5-inch), many-segmented body. He isn&rsquo;t poisonous
and won&rsquo;t sting or bite, but he may emit a substance
lethal enough to kill other insects in a confined area.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Of course, the chief daily events of life in the
desert are eating and being eaten, and predators that
favor a certain diet make it their business to be out
when their kind of dinner is around. Thus the grasshopper-eating
lizards brave the daytime heat to do
their hunting. Most often seen is the quick moving
western whiptail. The greenish collared lizard may
be seen racing along on his hind legs like a miniature
dinosaur. Lizards are about the biggest ground
dwellers you scare up on a noonday walk&mdash;unless
you happen on a lizard-eater like the big, pink
western coachwhip snake.</p>
<p>At twilight you become most aware of the desert&rsquo;s
residents. The coolness brings them out. Some must
hurry and eat before it gets full dark, while others
have the whole night ahead of them. At first you may
sense the desert&rsquo;s coming-to-life more by listening
than by looking. You hear the lesser nighthawk
trilling like a toad. Then, without warning, the whole
desert begins to sing, as katydids, grasshoppers, and
crickets join in a tapestry of sound so rich you can
almost touch it.</p>
<p>Soon the desert cottontail creeps from his thicket
to nibble pricklypear fruit. He stays close to home
and prefers brushy terrain. The blacktailed jackrabbit
passes the day in a form, a basin scratched out
beneath some bush. He can cover the ground in
enormous jumps, and his megaphone ears help cool
him by dissipating body heat. The desert mule deer,
another blacktailed, long-eared browser, may also
appear at dusk to forage mesquite and lechuguilla.
And a band of peccaries&mdash;or javelinas as they are
also called&mdash;may rattle through the brush. They
have a great fondness for pricklypear and their
mouths are so tough they eat roots, fruits, pads,
spines, and all. The ferocity of these wild pig relatives
is more fiction than fact. If you meet one face
to face, he may take a few steps toward you, but not
out of meanness. He&rsquo;s nearsighted!</p>
<p>Evening can linger a long time in the desert and
night can strike quickly as a cat&rsquo;s paw. You watch
the sun go down, turning the clouds above the Chisos
red, painting Sierra del Carmen crimson, while a
single golden shaft breaks through the clouds and
hits El Pico like a spotlight. Then the sky goes smoky
blue and mauve over the eastern mountains, and the
clouds to the west turn ashen as burned out coals.</p>

for desert living. Neither
drinks water, as a rule. The
roadrunner gets its moisture
largely from its omnivorous
diet, which includes lizards
and small rattlesnakes. It kills
them with stunning blows of
its beak. Its characteristic X-track
provides good traction
in sand. Agile and nimble,

(20 mph). Mexicans call the
roadrunner <i>paisano</i>, &ldquo;fellow
countryman.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pcap">The kangaroo rat metabolizes
both energy and moisture
from seeds that contain less
than 4 percent water. It has
no sweat glands and cools
itself by breathing. Its nasal
passages, cooler than the rest

moisture for retention. Its
kidneys, among the most efficient
in the animal world,
excrete uric wastes as a concentrated
paste, not as liquid,
saving further precious water.
Its deep burrow has a year-round

<p>You can see the nighthawk now against the pale and
pearly afterlight, and a star pops out, then another
and another. Suddenly, more stars seem to be twinkling
than can possibly exist in the universe. In the
absence of man-made light they are an overwhelming
presence. The Milky Way stretches from horizon to
horizon. Who can believe that our Sun is just a
middle-sized star, and planet Earth a mere speck
spinning on the fringes of that gorgeous luminosity?</p>
<p>On a night of no moon, in the mist of starlight, the
mule deer may stay active until dawn. On mild,
windless nights the hunters and the hunted come out
in full force: insect-eating scorpions, tarantulas, and
wolf spiders; seed-eating pocket mice and kangaroo
rats; rodent-eating snakes, badgers, and owls. What
a hurrying and scurrying, what popping up from
holes and burrows, what slithering and digging, what
squeaks and shrieks, what patient waiting in ambush.
And by what ingenious means do the hunters find
the hunted in the dark! Beep-beeping bats locate insects
and avoid obstacles by bouncing sound waves,
imperceptible to humans, off objects as they fly. The
female katydid wears her ears on her knees; by waving
her front legs she zeroes in on the male&rsquo;s mating
call. Cold-blooded rattlers heat-sense warm-blooded
rats and mice. And just as an astronomer opens the
aperture on his telescope, so the owl at night widens
his enormous eyes for light from far off stars.</p>
<p>Toward dawn the morning star burns like a lamp
in the east, and gradually, a pale flush spreads
upward from the crest of the Sierra del Carmen. A
bank of clouds hangs off the Fronteriza, and as the
overhead stars wink out and the morning star burns
on, the pale glow turns peach and seeps higher. Just
enough air stirs to shake the mesquite. A waking
bird emits one cluck. Soon the clouds below the
Fronteriza go salmon pink and flare with internal
fire. As the sun tops the Sierra del Carmen and spills
a glare sharp as ice shards over the desert, you hear a
distant bark. One yap, two, a soprano howl, an alto
tremulo, then chord upon chord in wild and worshipful
sounding chorus. Somewhere in the ruddy
hills a pack of coyotes seems to sing the sun up.</p>

<h3 id="c5">Waterholes, Springs, and the Fifth Season</h3>
<p>One of the most astonishing sounds in the desert is
that of trickling water. One of the happiest desert
sights is a pool dancing with aquatic creatures. Who
can believe it: Tadpoles darting about, water striders
dimpling the surface, blue darners stitching zig-zags
through the air and dipping the tips of their abdomens
into the water? What a celebration of life in
the midst of apparent lifelessness.</p>
<p>Water is the single most important need of almost
all life forms in the desert. The larger mammals,
many birds, and some insects must drink daily to survive.
Some amphibians and arthropods must spend
at least part of their lives in the water. Each waterhole
is a little oasis supporting its community of
plants and animals, and drawing from the outside
world a thirsty parade of creatures that comes to it
to sustain life.</p>
<p>Apart from the river, there are at least 180 springs,
seeps, and wells in the park that serve as wildlife
watering places. Most of these are springs located
within the grasslands on the lower slopes of the
Chisos Mountains. Springs differ greatly, ranging
from a seep with 0.5 centimeters (0.25 inches) of
water standing in the grass, to a 25-centimeter
(10-inch) deep pool the size of a table top, to a string
of pools connected by a flowing stream. Since
springs depend for their flow on water seeping
through the ground, and since this in turn depends
on rainfall, the amount of water found at a spring
may vary greatly from season to season and from
year to year. Other crucial factors are evaporation
and the water consumption and retention properties
of the spring&rsquo;s plant life.</p>
<p>You can see most springs a long way off. They
stand out like timbered islands in an ocean, with tall
cottonwoods, willows, and honey mesquite, and
man-high thickets of thorny acacia festooned in silver
showers of virgin&rsquo;s bower. Dozens of little rodent
holes perforate the ground among the roots and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
tall grasses quiver with furtive comings and goings.
Life at such a spring follows a regular pattern from
dawn to dusk, although it may actually be busiest at
night when most desert creatures are abroad.</p>
<p>At first daylight four or five redheaded turkey
vultures stir in the cottonwoods where they have
spent the night. They shrug their black shoulders
and wait for the sun and the thermals to rise. An
early blacktailed gnatcatcher chases a late moth, but
the moth proves the better acrobat and makes it to
safety in the thicket. Doves leave the ground with a
flutter of white-barred wings and level off across the
desert. By following the game trails to water, you
can read the sign of nighttime visitors: The cloven-hoofed
track of peccaries imprinted in the ooze,
cigar-shaped coyote scat complete with fur, the
flat-footed print of a striped skunk, and the larger
cloven hoofprints of mule deer.</p>

<p>Soon it is full morning with flies biting, lizards
scuttling, and butterflies feeding in jackass clover. By
noonday a brisk breeze is shaking the cottonwood
leaves, producing a sound like rushing water, and
two ravens have come to croak in a little mesquite.
Now they fly, with the sun striking silver from jet
feathers. They circle the oasis, flapping and soaring,
driving their shadows below them over the ground.</p>
<p>Here on a willow trunk is a life-and-death contest.
Rubbed raw by the branch of a neighboring tree, the
willow is exuding sap from a saucer-sized wound.
Drawn to the sap, six butterflies stand on the damp
spot peacefully feeding, slowly opening and closing
their wings. All at once a mantidfly pounces from
ambush and grabs at a butterfly with his clawed front
legs. The butterfly leaps like a scared horse, and in
reaction the whole group takes to the air. But in a
moment they settle back down, roll out their tongues
like party toys, and begin to sip. Another fierce
lunge by the mantidfly, another scattering of butterflies.
And all the time you can hear the tick-tick-tick
of a beetle boring a burrow in the diseased wood.</p>
<p>As evening comes on, the doves come in from the
desert, flying low along the line of seepage. The vultures
return to roost, lazily circling the cottonwood&rsquo;s
crown. While it is still light the butterflies seek cover
in the cottonwood leaves. As it gets dark the moths
come out, and after them the bats, beep-beeping as
they cut erratic patterns through the dusky air. Soon
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
the breeze will die down, and the starlit night will
throb with the long drawn trill of tree crickets. In the
wee small hours there will be no sound, no breath of
air or outward sign of life. Then suddenly along a
sandy trail moves a blackness shaped like a high-backed
child&rsquo;s chair. It is a striped skunk, tail-high,
come to take its turn at the waterhole.</p>

<p class="pcap">The javelina, or peccary,
smells like a skunk. This
nighttime wanderer uses the
scent for territorial marking,

</div>
<p>Few and far between are the springs with sufficient
flow to send a brook singing down a ravine. But
such a place is Glenn Spring, the chief spring along a
dry draw that starts in the Chisos and cuts deeply
through many-colored clays as it crosses the desert.
Historic photos show Glenn Spring enclosed within
a man-made rock wall. Today you cannot even find
the source, so thick is the tangle of tules and cane
grown up around it. The flow from Glenn Spring
trickles down the draw about 1.5 kilometers (1 mile),
collecting in pools and gurgling over rocks before it
goes underground. Some of the pools are crystal
clear, and some are black with the acids of plant
decay. Deeper pools are fern-green with algae. Little
black snails harvest algae on the rocks and leopard
frogs croak and plop, so quick to hide among the
reeds that you can hardly find them. These slim,
spotted amphibians, insect feeders, mate in water.
Their larval young, free-swimming tadpoles, must
live in water, feeding on microscopic organisms until
they grow lungs and legs for life ashore.</p>
<p>The tadpole itself falls prey to giant water bugs,
air-breathing water dwellers that are also strong
fliers. The water boatman is a vegetarian who sculls
about from one underwater plant to another. You
can hardly tell him from the backswimmer except
that the latter swings his oars upside down and
spends much time on the surface hanging head
down, the better to spy the aquatic insects upon
which he feeds. The water strider is another hunter,
but this spider-legged semi-aquatic skates atop the
water, seeking terrestrial insects that have dropped
onto the surface. Just as the birds and bats eat different
foods at different feeding levels, so do the creatures
that inhabit a pool, be it only centimeters deep.</p>
<p>And the creatures above the pool: The damselfly
alights on a reed and rests with its transparent, netlike
wings closed above its slim body. The stouter-bodied
dragonfly rests with its wings outstretched
and likes to fly in tandem. Both of these aerial
beauties must lay their eggs in water, and their
larvae are fully aquatic predators that breathe with
gills like fish.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Many of the same water insects inhabit yet another
type of waterhole, the tinaja, a natural pothole
that traps rain or runoff in solid rock. Dependent on
rainfall, tinajas often dry up, yet they may be the
only water source over a large area. If a tinaja is
deep enough it may survive evaporation, but the
water may shrink back so far below the lip of the
bowl that animals cannot reach it. A cougar once
drowned in a tinaja here because it could not climb
out again. Tinajas may also turn into death traps for
the plants and insects that inhabit them. In a well-balanced
pool the algae create the oxygen and food
that aquatic creatures need, but as the pool dries up
there is less and less oxygen and the products of
decay become concentrated. At last these become
so poisonous that the reproductive engine cuts off
and the pool is literally dead. But even a dead pool
may be a source of life to outside animals.</p>
<p>Ernst Tinaja is a good site for watching desert
wildlife. It lies in a rocky, canyon-like drainage near
the Old Ore Road. Though the upper tank measures
6 by 9 meters (20 by 30 feet) animals may not be able
to use it because when the water is 3 meters (10 feet)
deep it lies more than one-half meter (2 feet) below
the edge. But mule deer and javelina frequent the
smaller pools, which likely hold algae and a roster of
aquatic life.</p>
<p>Other important tinajas may be found on Mesa de
Anguila. The mesa top has a maze of trails leading to
and from tinajas that have served as a focus of life
across countless centuries. You can find Indian shelters
in the form of overhanging cliffs up and down a
canyon, with a permanent tinaja right in the middle.</p>
<p>Like the so-called lower animals mankind has long
been dependent on waterholes. Since the first prehistoric
Indians came to Big Bend, people have lived
beside springs and tinajas. And what a pleasant prospect
you still find from the sooted rock shelters above
Croton Springs as you look out across the grasslands
and the tules at the spring, toward the crenelated
wall of the Chisos. Rounded red boulders beside the
spring contain age-old mortar holes, ground so deep
you can stick your arm in up to your elbow.</p>
<p>Before the day of automobiles, all the peoples who
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
traveled through Big Bend routed their trails from
water to water. On the way to Oak Spring you can sit
in the shade of a Comanche marker tree, a great oak
bent in a bow with all its branches growing upright.
Comanches marked a good campsite by tying a
sapling down; with maturity it naturally assumed a
horizontal or bowed position.</p>

<p>As Big Bend opened to ranching, the need for
more watering places grew. Ranchers drilled wells,
put up windmills, and scraped out stock tanks. Some
of these waterholes remain to this day. The wells at
Dugout Wells and the Sam Nail Ranch are still maintained.
Without regular care such improvements
would soon disappear in the desert.</p>
<p>One of man&rsquo;s inadvertent &ldquo;improvements,&rdquo; the
tamarisk or salt cedar, has proved an unwelcome
water guzzler. The tree is about the size of an ordinary
apple tree, but it loses to the atmosphere about
five times as much moisture as an apple tree does. In
desert country where water is so scarce, tamarisks
pose a serious problem. Brought to this country from
the Mediterranean area for use as a windbreak, salt
cedar escaped cultivation and spread like wildfire
across the Southwest, invading river bottoms, drainage
ways, and waterholes in unbelievable numbers.</p>
<p>The tamarisk spreads by runners and apparently
reaches isolated springs when mammals and birds
bring seeds in on their fur and feathers. Growing at
the rate of nearly 2 meters (8 feet) in a summer, the
deep-rooted tamarisk uses up a disproportionate
amount of water and actually lowers the water table.
It is useless to man, and wildlife does not browse it
because it tastes so salty.</p>
<p>Big Bend National Park conducts a tamarisk eradication
program as a water conservation measure
centered about the springs. It is hot, dirty, time-consuming
work because tamarisks are almost impossible
to kill. No known creature can be used for
control, and if you leave so much as a root hair,
another tree will grow. You have to saw the tree off
and paint the stump with a special approved chemical
that does not harm other plants or wildlife and
will not contaminate the spring. This effort to save
the precious amounts of moisture stored in the Big
Bend landscape requires constant vigilance and back-breaking
effort.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">Big Bend Ranching Days</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Cattle ranching in the Big
Bend began about 1870 when
Milton Faver set himself up
as &lsquo;Don&rsquo; Milton not far from
today&rsquo;s Marfa. He eventually
built five spreads, including
the region&rsquo;s first sheep ranch.
As his headquarters he built
a fort at Cibolo (Buffalo)
Creek Ranch. The Army gave
him a cannon for it and even
garrisoned soldiers there
under his command. During
one difficult period, Indian
raids wiped out all Faver&rsquo;s
livestock except 40 calves
confined in the fort. With
superb swapping he rebuilt
his herds from the Indians
new largesse. By 1880 more
and more ranching was
pushed west into the Big
Bend by range shortages and
overgrazing east of the Pecos
River. Formal leasing and
land purchases followed. The
much sought-after lands had
springs. Fencing soon put an
end to the free range policy,
but as late as 1890 cooperative
roundups, branding, and
drives were still required to
sort out whose stock was
whose. Stock was stolen by
altering a legitimate brand.
This came to an end with the
introduction of barbed wire,
which changed ranching considerably.
Most of the grasslands
have never recovered
from overgrazing.</p>

<p>Big Bend has five seasons&mdash;winter, spring, summer,
fall, and that extra blooming season that bursts
out any time you have a good rain and other conditions
are right. The more rain, the more spectacular
the display, with flowers, buzzing insects, croaking
toads, and nesting birds in a complete new cycle
of regeneration. Imagine the gravel wastes of the
Castolon floodplain awash with flowers&mdash;solid carpets
of little white and yellow and purple blossoms
on either side of the road. Running back from it are
desert baileyas and grasses, with orange caltrop
blowing like orange butterflies in the wind. Picture
Cerro Castellan&rsquo;s red flanks green, with pockets of
ochre blossoms amid white heaps of volcanic ash.
Imagine Mesa de Anguila&rsquo;s talus slopes misted with
grass, Santa Elena Overlook smelling garden sweet
and so matted with little low-lying flowers that you
cannot put your foot down without crushing dozens.
You have never seen their like before and may not
soon again, for this is the floral profusion that
follows desert rains.</p>
<p>Most Big Bend rains come during the six warm
months from May through October, but the expected
rainfall may vary greatly with location and
with elevation. Thus the super-dry desert between
Mariscal Mountain and Castolon averages only 13
centimeters (5 inches) of rain in a year, while the
Chisos mountaintops may get more than 50 centimeters
(20 inches). Of course some years see more
than the average, some years much less. Falling as it
mostly does in torrents, very little rain penetrates the
thirsty soil. The water just rolls down the slopes,
rumbles through mountain canyons, gushes over a
pour-off, roars along dry washes, and spreads out
over lowland flats in fast-moving sheets heavy with
mud. A flash flood can root up and carry off trees
and other plants, animals in their burrows, automobiles
and their occupants, rocks, and the very earth
itself. Then almost as quickly as it came, it may go,
leaving gouged and gullied desolation in its wake.
Yet in a matter of days, these cracked and peeling
mudflats may blossom like a garden.</p>
<p>The reason is that millions and billions of wildflower
seeds lie dormant here, waiting for just the
right combination of soil temperature and moisture
to germinate and burst into bloom. Desert annuals
do not store up water as the cactuses do. They do
not put down deep taproots as the creosotebush
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
does. Nor do they dress themselves in thorny, waxy,
or woody shields as do the desert shrubs. Desert
annuals look for all the world like their counterparts
in more temperate country. They are just as colorful,
just as lavish with leaves, and just as spendthrift
with moisture. They live a brief, gaudy life in a
hurry, completing the cycle from germination to
seed production in a few, short, water-wasting weeks
before the desert dries out once again. Then they
pass months or even years in the seed stage, waiting
for another rain and another burst of luxuriant life.
This system works because the flowers produce so
many seeds, and because the seeds themselves are
marvelously drought resistant and programmed to
sprout only at the right time and in the right place.</p>
<p>Each annual and perennial species has its own
preferred blooming season and favored locale. The
long-legged Big Bend bluebonnet may start flowering
in December and keep on blooming until June.
Sometimes this rangy relative of the Texas bluebonnet
will bloom in such masses that the lowlands
look like they have been painted blue. The daisy-shaped
nicollet also likes gravelly soils, while the
desert verbena does best in disturbed areas. This
lavender-pink sweet william, a spring bloomer in the
lowlands, appears later at higher elevations as springtime
ascends the mountains. As a rule the spring
bloom peaks in the lowlands in April, and species
that prefer higher elevations flower a little later.
Thus the bracted paintbrush begins to flaunt its red
flags in June grasslands, and beautiful, deep blue
tube-flowers may be seen from May to July on snapdragon
vines in the Chisos woodlands. Usually the
luxuriance of the spring bloom will depend on the
amount of rain that fell during the preceding fall and
winter, and the months of June and July are apt to
show few flowers at lower, drier elevations. But with
summer rains in August and September, many springtime
flowers bloom again, sometimes more spectacularly.
These rains also produce a bright first
flowering from such summer and fall species as the
low-lying, sweet-smelling limoncillo, and the broomweed
that gold-plates Basin hillsides right through
October and November.</p>

<p>Many insects pass the dry months as the seeds do,
lying dormant in eggs or cocoons. The same life-giving
rains that waken the seeds quicken the insects.
And as the flowers come into their own there
is a mass emergence of flying, crawling, and creeping
creatures. The timing of this double emergence
is no accident. While the plant-eating insects feed,
they also pollinate the flowers.</p>
<p>So beautifully coordinated are these adaptations
that specialized flowers attract the very insects that
do them the most good. Bees perceive color in the
range of the spectrum from yellow through ultraviolet,
and you will find them on the many yellow
flowers of the pea family, blue larkspur, and lavender
ruellias. Bees don&rsquo;t distinguish red and orange, so
they pass up the brilliant paintbrush which does
attract hosts of butterflies. Flies, beetles, and other
insects pollinate relatively unspecialized plants like
the sunflowers. And night-flying moths respond to
the whites and yellows that almost glow in the dark.
In its caterpillar stage, the sphinx moth eats the
leaves of the night-blooming evening primrose. When
it matures the sphinx moth returns to the primrose
and, hovering like a hummingbird, unrolls its retractable
tongue and takes up nectar, thus paying its debt
to the primrose by pollinating the flowers.</p>
<p>Insect-eating and seed-eating birds capitalize on
each rain-induced harvest. The mourning dove, a
common park resident, usually nests in the spring,
but it may also nest again later in wet years. The
scaled quail may produce as many as four broods in
wet years, and you may see little brown chicks in
mid-October. You may even happen on a young
brown towhee high in the Chisos as late as November.
Barn swallows and cliff swallows, both summer
residents, nest as soon as they arrive in the spring,
and breed again in wet years during August. The
blackthroated sparrow may nest in both spring and
summer if rains have produced a good crop of seeds,
while the rufous crowned sparrow is actually busier
nesting in wet summers than in dry springs. The
black-chinned sparrow apparently waits for summer&rsquo;s
rainy season to nest.</p>
<p>Some mammal populations also rise and fall with
the rains. Ord kangaroo rats may not breed at all
during long periods of drought, but when a good
rainy season produces an abundance of seed, most
females soon become pregnant and produce two
litters. Females of the first litter may even bear
young of their own in the same breeding season.</p>

<h3 id="c6">As the Wild River Runs</h3>
<p>At 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) the golden eagle
glides on outspread wings, his head cocked down so
he can watch for signs of life upon that motionless
desert rolled out like a relief map below him. Largest
of Big Bend&rsquo;s airborne predators, the eagle needs an
enormous hunting range, and riding the warm air
currents high above the border, he can see it all: the
flattopped and arched mountains, the sun-bleached
lowland, and the silver Rio Grande disappearing and
reappearing as it runs downstairs through steep
canyons and open valleys. Tilting his two-meter
(7-foot) wings, the eagle slipslides for a closer look
into a canyon, spots the wake of a surface-swimming
snake, folds his wings, and dives like a fighter jet.
Before the snake even senses its peril, it is snatched
aloft and hangs wriggling in the eagle&rsquo;s talons as the
great bird, feathered to the toes, lifts and flies up the
canyon with mighty, measured wingbeats.</p>
<p>The waters dripping from the hapless snake&rsquo;s body
come from mountains far to the south and north.
The Rio Grande begins in springs and snows high in
Colorado&rsquo;s Rockies, but backed into reservoirs and
doled out to irrigate New Mexico and Texas farmlands,
it may hardly even flow below El Paso. What
gives the river a new lease on life is the Rio Conchos.
This beautiful stream rises in the western Sierra
Madres and flows northeastward across Mexico, cutting
canyons of its own and joining the Rio Grande
at Presidio, 160 river-kilometers (100 river-miles)
above the park. Some geologists say it was the Rio
Conchos, and not the Rio Grande, that cut those
gorgeous canyons in the park. No one knows for
sure. But once the river trapped itself, all it could do
was dig deeper and deeper by processes that are still
at work today.</p>
<p>A walk along a sandbar will show you that the
river functions as a practical sorting machine. The
water rolling by is so laden with sediment that you
cannot even see rocks 13 centimeters (5 inches)
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
below the surface. On the bar itself a layer of curling
and flaking mud lies on top of the larger stones and
gravel, which have fine sand deposited between
them. The heaviest rocks settle out first, then the
sand, and finally the finest particles. Water is a
powerful lifting and pushing tool, but these water-borne
abrasives do much of the river&rsquo;s work, wearing
out the rock, undercutting cliffs, deepening and
widening the canyons. It goes on at normal stages of
water where the river runs less than a meter (2-3
feet) deep, during floods when it crests at more than
6 meters (20 feet), and even during droughts when in
many places the river is too shallow to float a boat.
So in the slow course of geologic time the mountains
are worn away, spread across the valleys, and carried
out to sea.</p>
<p>The only streams that have a chance of leaving the
desert alive are those whose water sources lie outside
the desert. There are few such rivers in the
world: the Nile, the Indus, the Tigris and Euphrates,
the Colorado, and the Rio Grande. And what a
wealth of water-loving life the wild river brings to the
Big Bend desert. You can hang big catfish by the gills
from your saddlehorn and have your horse walk off
with fishtail dragging the ground. So the fishermen
tell you.</p>

</div>
<p>Life in this watery world is sustained by a food
pyramid based on a super-abundant supply of tiny
bottom organisms. A third-meter (1-foot) square of
riffle bottom has been found to contain more than
100 organisms. Most are larvae of flying insects:
stoneflies, mayflies, dragonflies, damselflies, water
and terrestrial bugs, various kinds of flies, midges,
and dobsonflies. These curious little creatures have
evolved ingenious ways of living, breathing, and eating
underwater. Some worm-like caddisfly nymphs
build protective cases around themselves, gluing
pebbles, bits of shells, and plants together with
saliva. They have three pairs of legs up front sticking
out of the case and a pair of hooks holding on to it
behind, so they can drag their houses with them as
they feed. Damselfly larvae breathe through three
leaflike gills that project from the hind end of the
abdomen, and when warm weather comes they crawl
ashore, split their skins, and emerge as gossamer-winged
adults. The gills on stonefly larvae extend
from the head and thorax, while mayfly nymphs
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
have seven pairs of gills standing out like feathers
along the sides of the abdomen. When oxygen is in
short supply, mayfly larvae vibrate their gills rapidly
so as to quicken the flow of water along their bodies.
Some aquatic larvae build nets to catch dinner; a
caddisfly nymph may spin a kind of silken windsock
that he hangs underwater with the narrow end
downstream, using the pressure of the current to
keep his prey trapped. Some aquatic larvae eat
microscopic plants, some eat insects, and some eat
each other. Large dragonfly nymphs may even catch
and eat small fish. Larvae are consumed by fishes,
frogs, and turtles.</p>

<p class="pcap">A rafter hauls out on a sandbank inside Mariscal Canyon,
the middle&mdash;and most sheer-walled&mdash;of Big Bend&rsquo;s big
three canyons. River runners thrill to Tight Squeeze, in
Mariscal Canyon, where a rock slab as big as a car
compresses the river into a tricky gap.</p>
</div>
<p>Probably the best way to get to know the river is to
get out on it. An easy run is through Hot Springs
Canyon, by 90-meter (300-foot) cliffs and over nice
little rapids. You put in at the site of the old Hot
Springs spa, and take out at Rio Grande Village,
having to paddle only at riffles.</p>
<p>Suppose it&rsquo;s early on a fine October morning and
you&rsquo;re floating along with the current, watching the
sky, clouds, cliffs, and river cane reflecting blue,
white, tan, and green on the glossy brown surface of
the water. The river is too muddy for you to see what
lives in it, but you can see the signs: a spreading
circle where a fish has snatched an insect from the
surface; mysterious little dimples that look like
miniature whirlpools; the beaked head and long
neck of a Texas softshell poked up like a periscope.
This big turtle&rsquo;s shell is really hard except along the
edges, but it is smooth and doesn&rsquo;t have the plates
you see on other Rio Grande turtles. The Big Bend
slider feeds primarily on plants, while the yellow
mud turtle enjoys water insect larvae. And ready to
oblige is a cloud of mayflies whirling in mad nuptial
flight a meter or two (3-7 feet) above the water. They
only live one day and exist as adults simply to mate,
but they will sow the river with numberless eggs.</p>
<p>As you round a bend, a pair of great blue herons
lifts from the shallows where they&rsquo;ve been standing
stilt-legged. Now with necks folded and long legs
dangling they flap across to the farther shore. Ahead
of you a blue-winged teal keeps lifting and settling
further downstream. Ducks are seldom seen on the
river in summer, but a dozen different species put
down as migrants, and some even winter on the
river. Now a slim pair of inca doves crosses overhead;
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
you see the flash of rufous wings and white tail
feathers. On a sandbar stands a spotted sandpiper,
head low and tail high. He takes a step, stops, teeters
up and down, and then flies.</p>
<p>The sandbar itself snugs in against the cliffside
with greenery growing in three distinct tiers. River
cane and mature salt cedar stand 4.5 meters (15 feet)
tall against the flagstones. And stairstepped in front
of these are seepwillows&mdash;not a willow at all, but a
kind of sunflower that pioneers sandbars&mdash;and a
younger, shorter stand of salt cedar. The canebrakes
fairly crackle with wintering birds: black phoebes,
cardinals, brown-headed cowbirds, and a migrating
yellow warbler, perhaps. There is plenty for them to
eat in that thicket. You yourself discover a nursery
of orange true bugs beautifully crossed with olive
green, all crowded together in every stage of development
on two or three willow leaves. But the most
intriguing thing about that sandbar is the record left
by its visitors: a lizard&rsquo;s five-toed track with the long
unbroken mark made by its tail, and the great blue
heron&rsquo;s left-and-right footprints striding along almost
in a straight line. You find the cat-like tracks of the
ringtail, the dog-like tracks of the gray fox, and the
flat-footed print of the hog-nosed skunk, pear-shaped
as a bear&rsquo;s. At the water&rsquo;s edge honey bees are collecting
moisture to water-cool their hive. One by one
they sip and lift off, making a beeline for a cliff.</p>
<p>In the canyons where water flows from wall to
wall, you find shore life restricted to those few plants
and animals that can make a home on a cliff face.
A spindly tamarisk has established a roothold in a
thimble-sized deposit of soil just above waterline,
and in cracks and crevices higher up, ocotillo and
pricklypear are working down from the desert that
tops the wall. Empty cliff swallow nests cluster on the
undersides of overhangs. In spring you might see baby
birds poking their heads from the colony&rsquo;s doorways.</p>
<p>Along the border, people call the Rio Grande by
its Mexican name, <i>Rio Bravo del Norte</i>. Nowhere
does the river seem more wild, more powerful than
inside Santa Elena, Mariscal, and Boquillas Canyons.
To enter one of these mighty limestone vaults
is to understand why mankind has always had to
skirt canyon country, and why to this day, except for
its historic fords, the river is all but impassable. If
you go in by boat the only way out is through. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
adventure calls for preparation, knowledge, hardiness,
and considerable skill.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig76">
<img src="images/img031.jpg" alt="" width="401" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">Cliff swallows colonize with
as many as 50 nests in close
order. How the adult birds
pick out their own condominium
from among such
clusters remains a mystery.</p>
</div>
<p>But even a landlubber can stand in the canyon&rsquo;s
primeval presence. All you must do is make it up the
ramps and steps that climb the cliff face at the
mouth of Santa Elena, then follow the foot trail down
again into the canyon. Looking up from the base of
these 450-meter (1,500-foot) walls, you see a vulture
and a raven soaring side by side along the canyon&rsquo;s
rim. To them you must seem small and as foolishly
occupied as the ants drawn up in opposing lines
across the sandy path. One step and you could crush
the horde. One rock fallen from that height and you
are gone. One wild storm upstream and you, the
ants, and the sandbar are all washed away forever.
Yet you are somehow drawn farther and deeper into
the canyon, into this jungle of dark green tamarisk
and emerald bermuda grass, through this labyrinth
of water-polished boulders, to land&rsquo;s end and water&rsquo;s
edge, to the very Beginning that laid these fossil
oyster shells in this fierce rock.</p>
<p>Here in the canyon&rsquo;s deep, vault-like isolation the
sense of time, that ominous, inhuman distance of the
Earth&rsquo;s past, may come over you as the imagined
shadow of the wings of a prehistoric reptile, the
Pterosaur, perhaps, from 65 million years ago. This
was the biggest flying animal ever known to have
lived. Picture a 70-kilo (150-pound) flying reptile
with a wing spread of up to 11 meters (36 feet), a
foolishly long neck, and large head with a long,
slender, toothless jaw. Add long legs, and short toes
armed with sharp, hooked claws, and a body covered
with fur-like material. And figure that each of
those long, narrow, glider-type wings was a thin
membrane supported by a single overgrown finger,
and attached to the body, bat-style, right down to the
knee. How could such a huge, ungainly thing ever
lift off or fly?</p>
<p>A species does not survive unless it can compete
for food and escape its predators, and Pterosaurs,
both large and small, existed alongside aggressive,
meat-eating dinosaurs for 140 million years. Unlike
some smaller species found elsewhere, the Big Bend
Pterosaur does not seem to have fished the ocean. At
that time, Big Bend offered a river and floodplain
environment far from the sea. No one knows how
this giant Pterosaur made its living.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h4 class="interlude">How the Canyons Were Formed</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Some 200 million years ago this region lay under a sea
whose sediments formed the structural, limestone bedrock
patterns of the Big Bend. The basic landscape configurations
of today&rsquo;s park were set in motion 75 to 100 million
years ago as the landscape emerged, folded, and faulted.
Then erosion set in.</p>
<p>The ancestral river that carved Santa Elena, Mariscal,
and Boquillas Canyons through bedrock was the Rio
Conchos. (The present Rio Conchos contributes most of
the water flowing through today&rsquo;s Big Bend. It flows
into the Rio Grande just upstream of the park.) When
the ancestral river hit the limestone mountain uplifts,
it had no alternative but to cut its way through.
Steep-walled, narrow canyons resulted. Santa Elena
Canyon is cut through the Mesa de Anguila. Mariscal
Canyon severs its namesake mountains. Boquillas Canyon,
the longest, cuts through the massive limestone Sierra
del Carmen. You can see how steep these canyons are by
taking a river trip (see <a href="#Page_122">page 122</a>) or hiking park trails (see
<a href="#Page_119">page 119</a>) to the river or to canyon rims.</p>
<p>The region was once much higher in elevation than it is
today, but erosion has taken its toll. Mountains and mesas
are landscape formations
whose rock erodes more slowly than surrounding materials do.
Castle-like peaks and high, sharp-rimmed mesas stand as weathered
monuments to earlier times when elevations were higher.
Such stranded vestiges of
geologic eras punctuate the
stark Chihuahuan Desert
landscape with eerie architecture.
Astronauts have used
Big Bend terrain to simulate
moonscapes.</p>
<p>The sequence of geologic
diagrams shows how the Big
Bend canyons formed and
what their future would be if
slow processes of erosion
continue.</p>

<p>When you think that the Earth is perhaps 4.5 billion
years old, that complex organisms have existed
for no more than about 700 million years, that the
oldest rocks exposed in the park are 300 million
years old, and that fossils of backboned animals in
the park cover a time span of 70 million years, you
can realize how fragmentary the fossil record really
is. You get few glimpses of the relatively recent past,
but these are astonishing.</p>
<p>For example, geologists know that back in the dim
dark distances of Earth time, Big Bend lay repeatedly
at the bottom of the sea. Convulsions within the
Earth repeatedly raised these sea floors to the tops
of mountains, and time after time these mountains
wore away. One of the ancient ocean beds can be
seen at Persimmon Gap where, in remnants of the
park&rsquo;s oldest mountains, fossil sponges, brachiopods,
and other simple marine organisms lie exposed. For
hundreds of millions of years the three-lobed trilobite
was among the most prolific animals in the world,
but it had long been extinct when the last great
ocean, the so-called Cretaceous sea, washed across
Big Bend. Most of Mexico lay submerged and a sort
of mid-continent seaway cut North America in two
about on the line of the Rocky Mountains. In its early
stages this sea harbored ancestral clams, oysters,
snails, corals, and a coiled shellfish called an ammonite.
You can see these animals preserved in the
limestone walls of Santa Elena Canyon. Giant clam
shells a meter (3 feet) across and fossil fishes preserved
in the round between Boquillas and Mariscal
Mountain tell us what lived in later seas. Sea turtles,
sharks, and a 9-meter (30-foot) marine lizard that
swam in the open ocean have left their remains in the
yellowish badlands near the park&rsquo;s western entrance.</p>
<p>Late in this oceanic period the Rocky Mountains
began to rise to the north of Big Bend, the Sierra
Madre to the south. The park&rsquo;s own Santiago, del
Carmen, and Mariscal ranges, and the first upward
thrust of the Chisos also occurred at this time. As
the mountains rose and started to wear away, delta
deposits began to build out farther and farther into
the seaway, forming barrier bars and tidal shelves
where turtles, snails, oysters, and sharks lived and
died. Gradually the near-shore, subtidal environment
changed to a tidal flat. This in turn changed to
marsh, to beach, to brackish and freshwater lagoons,
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
and finally to an estuary and river floodplain environment.
Such was the Big Bend world to which the
dinosaurs came. They had been ruling the Earth for
eons, but they did not reach the park until the
Cretaceous sea withdrew.</p>

</div>
<p>Sloshing about in the freshwater were amphibious
and semi-aquatic species. Probably commonest was
the duckbill dinosaur, an enormous reptile that
walked on huge hind legs. It had as many as 2,000
teeth. Specially adapted for grubbing up and munching
freshwater plants, these flat grinders occurred in
batteries in the duckbill&rsquo;s jaw. As a tooth wore out,
another popped into place.</p>
<p>Tramping about on all fours and peaceably cropping
land plants were bizarre looking horned dinosaurs
with turtle-like beaks. For their weight they
must have had the most powerful jaws of any backboned
animal that ever lived. Armored species included
one that looked like a horned toad the size of
a dump truck. Another sported a huge lump of bone
on the end of its tail, still another a thick lump of
bone above a brain no bigger than the end of your
little finger. The world&rsquo;s largest crocodile, a 15-meter
(50-foot) creature with 15-centimeter (6-inch) teeth,
turned up in the park, but remarkably few bones of
meat-eating dinosaurs have ever been found. One of
the Earth&rsquo;s great mysteries is why, at the top of their
terrific form, the dominant dinosaurs died out? This
happened in a geologically short time all around the
globe. Perhaps it was because the highly specialized
reptiles couldn&rsquo;t cope with changes in their environment
as the world climate grew cooler and more
continental. No one really knows.</p>
<p>When the Age of Mammals began some 64 million
years ago, Big Bend lay on an alluvial floodplain
where summers were moist and winters were mild.
Shallow rivers meandered between natural levees
wooded with flowering plants, sycamore, stinking
cedar, and tree ferns. Garfish swam in rivers and isolated
ponds, while small lakes and swamps lingered
on in meander cutoffs and abandoned river channels.
It was a land where seasonal floods alternated
with dry periods and where, during protracted dry
spells, treeless areas invaded the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h4 class="interlude">The Fossil Record</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Garfish and turtles in the Rio Grande give us a hint about
life here 50 million years ago. Then they swam in waters
haunted by crocodiles and visited by the modern horse&rsquo;s
earliest ancestor, Hyracotherium; the hippo-like Coryhodon;
and Phenacodus, an early species of ungulate
related to both hoofed and clawed mammals.</p>
<p>Fossils of these and other animals belie dry and barren
Tornillo Flat&rsquo;s earlier Eocene life as a lushly vegetated
landscape, as depicted in this reconstruction.</p>
<p>At the time of this scene the dinosaurs (&ldquo;terrible lizards&rdquo;)
had been extinct for 15 million years. Their fossils occur
here too. Remains of the giant Pterosaur have been found.
These &ldquo;winged lizards&rdquo; were flying reptiles whose 11-meter
(36-foot) wingspan exceeded that of small jet fighters. The
wing was a featherless membrane stretched out from the
reptile&rsquo;s body to the tip of its greatly enlarged fourth digit.
Fossil remains of Brontosaurus, Allosaurus, Icthyosaur,
and others have been found. Fossil Ammonites (see <a href="#Page_67">page 67</a>),
related to today&rsquo;s sea-dwelling chambered nautilus,
represent the even earlier period when today&rsquo;s Big Bend
was covered by a shallow inland sea. Sample fossils are
displayed in a shelter off the Marathon entrance road near
Tornillo Creek bridge.</p>

<p>With such a wealth of habitats a whole new host of
animals took over Big Bend. Crocodiles and turtles
hung on from the Age of Reptiles, but nature&rsquo;s
evolutionary torch passed to the warm-blooded mammals
who increased rapidly in numbers, size, and diversity.
Remains of 29 species of early, extinct forest-dwelling
mammals have been discovered near the
Fossil Bone Exhibit site on Tornillo Flat. This same
floodplain later accommodated a hippo-like plant-eater,
a browsing collie-sized mammal, a panther-like
cat, and the little ancestral horse, Eohippus. No
bigger than a fox terrier, Eohippus had not yet developed
the typical horse hoof and still had four toes on
his front feet and three on his hind. He browsed
among low forest plants, because nature hadn&rsquo;t yet
invented grass.</p>
<p>Some 20 million years ago, when we get our next
glimpse of the Big Bend, grasses were well established
and the Earth began to witness the rapid rise
of grazing animals. In the park, Castolon had a
savanna-type environment, with a sub-humid to semi-arid
climate. Rabbits and camel- and sheep-like
mammals flourished. Plant eaters ranged in size from
a tiny mouse to an enormous rhinoceros. This giant
was about 3 meters (10 feet) long, stood 2 meters (7
feet) high at the shoulder, and had massive, bony
horns on its head. There were also carnivores to
fatten on the herbivores.</p>
<p>In the middle of the Age of Mammals, Big Bend
country became the seat of widespread and repeated
volcanic disturbances, with lava flows, ash falls, and
mountains bulging up like blisters as they filled with
molten rock. Here, most of these events centered on
the Chisos, where the signs can be seen in mountain
peaks to this day. Much of what happened since has
not even left a shadow; the record and the rocks
have both been erased by millions of years of
weathering and erosion. But you can see &ldquo;living
fossils&rdquo; in the high Chisos canyons. These are the
ponderosa pines, Arizona cypress, and Douglas-fir
trees descended from the moist woodland species
that populated this region during the last Ice Age.
Occasional remains of the great Ice Age mammoths
have also come from gravels in deeply eroded ravines.
And you can see all around you the evidence
of two latecomers who seem to have reached Big
Bend around the same time: Man and the Desert.
But here, deep in the river&rsquo;s canyon, both are
apparently as remote from you as your own daily
world.</p>

<h3 id="c7">Along the Greenbelt and Among the Grasses</h3>
<p>Even in the dead of night it smells green beside the
silt pond at Rio Grande Village. Well, <i>dusty</i> green
perhaps, but redolent with reeds and shrubs, trees
and grass, with the very jungle breath of the floodplain.
On the other side of the river a lone cock
crows and close at hand there&rsquo;s a rustling of leaves, a
crackling of reeds, the lap-lap of some animal drinking.
Leopard frogs croak on in unconcerned bass and
baritone burps, sounding like someone&rsquo;s stomach
talking. But all at once something has a frog for
dinner and the unwilling meal keeps pumping out
shrieks, faster and faster and louder and shriller,
to the last breath. Then silence. The frog chorus
grumbles on.</p>
<p>In the morning you find the flat-footed tracks,
long-fingered as a human hand, of that nocturnal
hunter. The raccoon is an omnivore, an opportunist
with a taste for whatever it can find: amphibians,
shellfish, mesquite beans, acorns, cactus fruits, rodents,
garbage. The little masked bandit can in fact
make himself a campground pest. His dependence
on water keeps him a prisoner of the floodplain, but
the river, the springs, the sloughs, and the ponds
provide abundance in a narrow green world unrolled
like a ribbon across the desert. Sometimes this
greenbelt, as it is called, is no wider than a bush; in
places it may measure three-quarters of a kilometer
(half a mile). And it keeps changing, widening with
floods, narrowing in droughts, altering course with
the river itself.</p>
<p>Just such a change of channels apparently created
the bench of bottomland where Rio Grande Village
lies today. People have been camping here for
thousands of years, as shown by the many deep
mortar holes where meal was ground in the limestone
ledges near the pumping station. Certainly the
place had much to recommend it: wood and water,
abundant game, rich soils, an agreeable winter climate,
and beautiful views of river and mountains.
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
After the white man came to stay in the early 1900s
most of the native flora changed. Farmers cleared
the bottomland to plant cotton and grains, cut down
the lanceleaf cottonwoods for roofbeams, dredged
ponds and ditches, and enclosed springs. Nowadays,
the plants you see are often exotics brought in from
outside to create shade and lawns.</p>
<p>Such are the eastern cottonwoods with their heart-shaped
leaves, the evergreen live oaks and smooth
sycamores, the sweet-smelling honey locust and eucalyptus
trees, and that fine green carpet of Bermuda
grass. Like the farmers&rsquo; field crops, these interlopers
cannot flourish without irrigation and sometimes
even that is not enough. Dozens of eastern cottonwoods
have died in recent years.</p>
<p>A good place to see native plants and animals is
along the Rio Grande Village Nature Trail, which
starts at the campground and leads to a hill above
the river. A walk along this trail is doubly interesting
because it shows greenbelt and shrub desert side by
side, the two habitats often separated by less than a
vertical or horizontal meter. The jungle starts at the
edge of the clearing and almost at once you come
upon a warm spring run. This may be where the rare
little Big Bend mosquitofish, <i>Gambusia gaigei</i>, originated,
but all you see today is a larger relative,
<i>Gambusia affinis</i>. These five-centimeter (two-inch)
predators, little as they are, soon take over. They
apparently are invaders from the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>In wet weather this whole spring area becomes a
swamp and even in dry times moisture-loving plants
crowd the trail. You pick your way beneath black
willow trees and grapevines festooned with wild
grapes, stop to admire the yellow tube-flowers on the
tree tobacco, stoop to avoid a spear slanting from
the solid wall of common and giant cane. These two
tall woody grasses stand 4.5 meters (15 feet) high and
put out great, plume-like flowering heads that shine
silver in the sun. Indians used the stems for arrow
shafts and ate the roots raw, roasted, or boiled.
Many an early settler roofed and even walled his
house with cane. Today the reeds supply deer and
cattle with attractive browse, and the thickets serve
both as home and hunting ground for birds, small
mammals, and reptiles.</p>
<p>Here is the cleverly constructed nest of a gray
wood rat. And there, crouched beneath a bush like
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
some storybook monster is an enormous spiny lizard.
Rosy and gray, he peers back unblinking, still
as a stone, then melts away so quickly he is gone
before you see him move.</p>
<p>A little further on the trail climbs a short rise,
topping out on Chihuahuan Desert complete with
creosotebush, dog cholla, ocotillo, and the standard
collection of cactuses. If you take the trail in spring
or summer, the mound-building strawberry cactus
will be covered with hot pink blossoms and delicious
fruit. By fall the fiercely barbed blades of the false-agave,
or hechtia, will have taken on a reddish tinge.
In wintertime the tasajillo cactus will be dressed like
a tiny Christmas tree in long green spines and bright
red fruits. But at any season this water-starved scene
stands in sharp contrast to the marsh, rank with
reeds and bulrushes, that lies just below.</p>
<p>Unlikely as it may seem you are looking at a
beaver pond backed up behind an actual beaver dam
hidden in the reeds. The wary, nocturnal beaver is
seldom seen and you will look in vain for the familiar
beaver lodge, because Big Bend beavers make do
with what the floodplain has to offer. Instead of
building wooden houses, these rodents dig burrows
in the river bank, foraying from there to feed on
willow, cottonwood, seepwillow, and river cane.
Around the turn of the century the Rio Grande and
its main tributaries abounded with beaver, but fur
traders trapped them to the brink of extinction,
woodcutters and farmers destroyed their food supply,
and cattle feeding in the canebrakes trampled
their burrows.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine just what destroying the trees
and ground cover can do to fertile land and to a
living stream, but a visit to Terlingua Abaja shows
you. James B. Gillett, foreman of the famous G-4
Ranch, recalled that in 1885 &ldquo;the Terlingua was a
bold running stream, studded with cottonwood timber
and was alive with beaver.&rdquo; There was one grove
of trees where he had seen at least 1,000 head of
cattle enjoying the shade. But after the Terlingua
mines opened, Mexican farmers established a community
at Terlingua Abaja, a few kilometers up the
creek from its junction with the Rio Grande. All the
cottonwoods up and down the creek fell to construction
and hungry mine furnaces and the virgin earth
turned bottom up beneath the plow and grubbing
hoe. Today this once fertile valley is a wasteland.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">The Rare Big Bend Mosquitofish</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The Big Bend mosquitofish (<i>Gambusia gaigei</i>) has a miniscule
geographic range. Not only is it restricted to the
park, as some other species are, but it is also restricted
to one pond. The fish was first identified in 1928 in Boquillas
Spring. Unfortunately, the spring soon dried up and for
some 20 years the fish was thought extinct. In 1954 more
were found near Rio Grande Village. This group was later
threatened, and a pond was built especially for the fish.
But people dumped into the pond other fish that ate this
tiny mosquitofish. At one point the world&rsquo;s only survivors
were two males and a female, Rio Grande Villagers
that biologists had removed to a laboratory aquarium at
the University of Texas at Austin. A cold winter again
killed nearly the whole park population, and again
the Austin-raised stock replenished it. <i>Gambusia gaigei</i>
gives birth to live offspring and has been around as a
species since mastodons. They feed largely on mosquito larvae.</p>

<p>Since the coming of the park, cottonwoods have
returned to the floodplain, especially at Castolon. A
stately colonnade of eastern cottonwoods lures ladderback
woodpeckers and yellow-bellied sapsuckers
to Cottonwood Campground. More than 100 lanceleaf
cottonwoods may be seen along the road that
leads to Santa Elena, Mexico. Standing as much as
30-meters (100-feet) tall, refreshingly green in summer
and gorgeous gold in fall, cottonwoods seek
water by spreading horizontal roots far and wide,
and by sending taproots deep down to the water
table. They propagate in early summer by shaking
millions of cottony seeds upon the wind. These fuzzy
white parachutes may lie in windrows or cover the
ground downwind like new fallen snow.</p>
<p>Along the River Road from Castolon to Santa
Elena Canyon, you get another glimpse of what
water means in the desert. The road winds along the
edge of an alluvial bench from 15 to 30 meters
(50-100 feet) high. Atop this terrace you have the
widely spaced shrubs of the Chihuahuan Desert, but
peer over the edge and you find a dense green
wilderness crowded between the benchface and the
river. All that separates lifeless sand from green
jungle is the vertical distance that stops the water.
Down there salt cedars have packed themselves
thickly into the narrow space.</p>
<p>Another water-loving plant prevalent along the
river and dry washes is honey mesquite, a feathery,
thorned shrub- or tree-sized member of the pea family.
Its root system, with a deep tap root, is so extensive
that more wood lies underground than shows
above ground, and natives say you must &ldquo;dig for
wood&rdquo; here. Mesquite trees multiply as persistently
as salt cedar, but are highly useful to man and to
wildlife. Honey bees and butterflies visit the yellow
mesquite flowers, quail roost in the branches, and
wood rats collect mesquite beans in tremendous
numbers. Deer, horses, and cattle also relish the
beans, while Indians and early settlers made a nutritious
bread from mesquite bean flour. Honey mesquite
carries the standard Kentucky-wonder type of
bean. But the screwbean mesquite or <i>tornillo</i>&mdash;for
which Tornillo Creek was named&mdash;puts out a curious
cluster of corkscrew-shaped fruit pods. Mesquites
often mass together in thickets, and they do
very well in the drier soils of arroyos, often rubbing
thorns with acacias, a family of sweet-smelling,
flowering trees and shrubs attractive to honey bees
and hummingbirds. The roots of these thickets provide
apartments for scores of floodplain pocket
gophers, kangaroo rats, and hispid cotton rats.</p>

<p class="pcap">A greenbelt along a wash contrasts
sharply with surrounding desert habitat.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Despite the luxuriance and rapid growth of floodplain
flora, life along the greenbelt rests in precarious
balance. The floodplain is the one place in the
park from which domestic cattle have never been
successfully removed. The problem is that Mexican
cows, horses, and burros do not recognize international
boundaries.</p>
<p>There was a day when cows grazed grasslands at
higher elevations, and before the cows could be seen
herds of pronghorns, golden, graceful, large-eyed,
with black horns and white rump patches. Imagine if
you can how Tornillo Flat must have looked at the
turn of the century with fine grasses bending under
the wind and the pronghorns flashing their rump
patches in sudden semaphore. Depending on speedy
flight for protection, pronghorns seek wide-open
places where they can see a long way off. Today,
Tornillo Flat is a bald shrub desert. The pronghorns
vanished long ago. The small band sometimes seen
north of Tornillo Creek is the remnant of a herd
reintroduced in the 1940s.</p>
<p>The grass that flourished on Tornillo Flat in its
heyday was a very good clump-forming grass called
tobosa. To the first settlers it looked as though there
was more grass along Tornillo Creek than could ever
be eaten off. Yet the tobosa soon disappeared,
falling first to mowing machines and finally to the
domestic herds that cropped it out of existence. Hay
balers plied Tornillo Flat into the 1930s.</p>
<p>Grasses spread through seed germination, and in
some cases by underground and aboveground stems.
As a general rule, root depth equals the height of the
grass, but half of the root system dies back each
year. This is natural and even desirable since the
dead roots create new soil and you still have a sound
root system if the grass isn&rsquo;t topped too much. But
heavy overgrazing causes grass roots to die back
even more and creates an abnormally shallow root
system. This is doubly dangerous in desert country
where heat and the need to search out water pose
crucial problems for all plants. Nor is this all,
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
because other good things come&mdash;and other good
things go&mdash;with a healthy ground cover. As each
year&rsquo;s grasses die back they fertilize the soil and
insulate seedlings and roots from the sun&rsquo;s killing
heat, but when this cover is reduced, good grasses
disappear and poorer grasses take over. Surface
conditions are finally so changed that neither grasses
nor grassland forbs and shrubs can grow. Seedlings
may burst into brief life with a rain but when the sun
bears down again day after day the unprotected
plants perish. With nothing to hold it the soft topsoil
blows and washes away. Desert downpours soon
gully the ground, changing drainage patterns and
lowering the water table beyond the reach of short
grass roots. Longer rooted desert shrubs move in,
first the shortlived tarbush, and finally creosotebush.
The result is seen on Tornillo Flat today: typical
Chihuahuan shrub desert with sparsely scattered
creosotebush and cactuses.</p>
<p>What happened at Tornillo Flat also happened to
other park grasslands. Chino grama, ignored by
cattle and goats, but relished by sheep and horses, is
and was the dominant grass of the Big Bend foothills.
By 1944, overuse had so stripped the grasslands near
Government Spring that you could hardly find a
bunch of chino on the bare beige hills. Even in the
mountains proper the grasses had all but disappeared,
and biologists conducting an ecological survey
found that the South Rim looked and smelled
like a goat paddock.</p>
<p>Once the park was established and domestic animals
were removed, native grasses got the chance to
reestablish themselves. At first nature itself blocked
recovery. For seven long years drought ruled all life
in Texas. When the rains finally did come, grasses
improved at different rates in different places. They
had the most difficult time at lower elevations where
heat and aridity are greatest. Several attempts to
seed Tornillo Flat have been made, but it may take
decades for these once bountiful bottomlands to
green again. Grasses in the grassland belt surrounding
the Chisos have made a remarkable comeback,
however. In ten short years ground cover increased
30 percent. Grasses at the higher elevations are now
probably as rich as ever.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">The Fur Trade</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Furs were an active commodity in the Big Bend until
about 1940. Beaver once abounded along the river and
its tributaries. Both fur bearers and predators were taken.
The bighorn sheep was largely extirpated, selling for
a time as &ldquo;Mexican goat.&rdquo; Wolves were extirpated before
the park could provide refuge. Not all species were
trapped. The javelina was hunted during World War I,
for use in gloves, coats, and suitcases. The bristles went
into brushes. Elmo Johnson (photo) bought furs from
trappers at his trading post. Good profits required a good
eye for raw furs, which Johnson possessed. Furs not
trapped during the animal&rsquo;s winter prime were nearly
worthless, and values depended on their condition
generally. No fur market existed in Mexico, so furs
trapped there were sold at Texas trading posts, destined
for the fur houses in St. Louis, Missouri. Only a portion of
Johnson&rsquo;s fur stocks shows in this 1929 photograph. Furs
were a good business for him, because trappers took their
value in goods, his first profit in the transaction. He then
sold the furs for his second profit. Later, salaried government
trappers worked this area to control predators.
Today, all wildlife in the park is protected.</p>

<p>Different kinds of grasses have adapted themselves
to different soils and altitudes and grow in
company with different co-dominant plants. In colorful
sequence the grasses create a three-dimensional
mosaic that begins on the edges of the shrub desert,
covering the foothills and running up through the
woodlands out onto mountaintop meadows. You
can see these differences quite easily.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig94">

<p class="pcap">The U.S. Boundary Survey trekking the Big Bend country

portrait came to adorn the survey report.</p>
</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s ten o&rsquo;clock on a fine fall morning, and
you are driving from Rio Grande Village up to the
Basin. You find shrub desert all around you at first,
with the usual creosotebush, ocotillo, and pricklypear.
The only grass you see grows in a buff-colored
strip on either side of the road, where runoff from
infrequent rains creates a habitat moist enough for
grasses to germinate and reach maturity. But after
you pass 900 meters (3,000 feet) of elevation you
begin to see the first sparse bunches of chino grama
spotted here and there across the desert. Somewhere
just below the Dugout Wells turnoff you find quite a
bit of bunch grass among the bushes. Almost imperceptibly
the chino thickens until at 1,000 meters
(3,500 feet) the hillsides appear cobbled over with
lumps the color of gray rock. It appears that you
couldn&rsquo;t step down without stubbing your toe against
a clump of gray-green grass or lechuguilla. Soon all
the slopes are patterned yellow and gray-green as
solid stands of lechuguilla crowd into the chino
grama. The grass is so thick now that scaled quail
hunt seeds along the roadside and cottontail rabbits
bounce jauntily across in the mid-morning sunlight.</p>
<p>The colors you see owe much to the angle of the
sun, but at about 1,200 meters (4,000 feet), near
Panther Junction, the plants themselves add a soft
new hue, the beautiful silver-blue of ceniza shrubs.
Bunches of vivid green grass crop up amid the tawny
three-awns by the roadside, and the tops of the
tarbush are brushed with yellow. Rock, gravel, grass,
and shrub blend together in shades of tan, gray,
green, and blue pinpointed by Christmas-red fruits
on the guayacan, with once again vast gardens of
chartreuse lechuguilla and skeleton-leaf goldeneye
shrubs. These rolling grasslands have much less
pricklypear and creosotebush, and they have a lower
profile than the shrub desert. Here and there the
Torrey yucca lifts its shaggy head high, but the whole
land surface looks somehow smoother, less hob-nailed
than before.</p>
<p>When you start the 11-kilometer (7-mile) climb
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
toward the Basin, chino grama gives way to a variety
of grasses, blue, black, hairy, and side oats grama,
and the straw-colored grass aptly named tanglehead.
The whole color scheme changes with the grass from
shades of gray to reddish brown and yellow, and the
tops of these good grasses have the heavy headed
look of grain. The lechuguilla becomes less obvious.
Gradually the moisture-loving mountain shrubs push
the grasses back from the roadside, but the golden
gramas grow with wonderful abundance on the drier
slopes beyond. Still higher, the still good grasslands
are studded now with century plant, basket grass,
and sotol.</p>

</div>
<p>Earlier in this century sotol abounded between
Green Gulch and Government Spring, but in the severe
drought during World War I, ranchers chopped
it out for cattle feed. Today you will find a perfect
forest of sotol growing at Sotol Vista on the western
flank of the Chisos. As you can see from the overlook,
this narrow-bladed plant favors the cooler
north-facing exposures. Sotol leaves grow at ground
level from a short trunk, and nearly every spring the
plant thrusts up a brush-like bloomstalk, 4 to 6
meters (15-20 feet) tall, covered half its length by
greenish-white flowers. Prehistoric Indians had many
uses for sotol, and later the Chisos Apaches often
located their rancherias at solid stands of &ldquo;desert
candle.&rdquo; They used the fibrous leaves in making
mats and ropes, fermented a potent drink from the
pineapple-like heart, or roasted it in rock-lined pits
as we roast beef. Several crumbling sotol pits are
found throughout the Chisos, and sotol still serves as
an all-purpose plant along the border.</p>
<p>Sotol is one of those Big Bend plants that has its
very own grasshopper. If you look closely, you may
find a little fellow feeding high on the bloomstalk
and looking for all the world like a bud. He lives his
whole life on the sotol plant and knows just how to
use it to advantage. If you annoy him he will
probably play possum, drawing in his legs and dropping
like a stone right down into the thick of the
sotol leaves. Few predators come away unscathed
from a close encounter with those saw-edged blades.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h4 class="interlude">Indians of the Big Bend</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Evidence of Paleo-Indian culture dates back to about
9000 B.C. here. The Archaic and Neo-American culture
sites date from about 6000 B.C. These occur near today&rsquo;s
water sources, so climate conditions then were
probably similar to now. The Archaic people used the
atl-atl, a dart-pointed throwing stick, to hunt game animals.
The Neo-Americans used the bow and arrow.
Spaniard Cabeza de Vaca encountered their descendants
in his 1535 expedition through the area. In the 1640s the
major Indians here were the Tobosas, Salineros, Chisos,
and Tepehuanes, who fought Spanish encroachment and
enslavement. Spanish horses enabled the Mescalero
Apaches to expand their range and dominate the area
by the 1740s. They became the Chisos Apaches. By the
1840s, the Comanches, also with Spanish horses, dominated
an enormous range focused on the Big Bend. When
Texas was annexed by the United States in 1845, the
U.S. military became the Indians&rsquo; antagonist. Forts
strung along the route to California goldfields after
1849 sliced the Indian territory in half.</p>
<p>Retreating far into the mountains, the last Apaches, under
Chief Victorio, were defeated by Col. Benjamin
H. Grierson and scattered into Mexico. There Victorio
was soon killed by Mexican troops. Col. William H.
Shafter continued the Army&rsquo;s Indian pacification
after March 1881. Not all Indians were hostile. The
painting, by Capt. Arthur Lee, shows West Texas Indians
trading at Fort Davis.</p>

<p>Another lily of the desert is the yucca. Overabundance
of this perennial often indicates abuse of a
grassland, and yucca gradually thins out again once
a good grass cover is reestablished. Several species
of yucca flourish in Big Bend. Most widely scattered
is the Torrey yucca or Spanish dagger. Seen from
desert lowland to mountain top, it thrives at Persimmon
Gap near the park&rsquo;s north entrance.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig99">
<img src="images/img042.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">One of six yucca species in
the park, the giant dagger
abounds in Dagger Flat. It
blooms every two or three
years from late March
through April.</p>
</div>
<p>Yucca grows like sotol from a central trunk, but it
adds new growth at the top and lets its dead leaves
drop down in a palm-like grass skirt. The yucca also
puts up a bloomstalk year after year, and the creamy
flowers are a favorite browse of deer and cattle.
Yuccas may live from 50 to 75 years, reaching
tree-like proportions. The giant dagger that gives
Dagger Flat its name may grow more than 6 meters
(20 feet) tall. In good years it blooms around Easter-time,
and a single bloomstalk may have more than
1,000 flowers and weigh as much as 30 kilos (70
pounds). Indians used nearly every part of the yucca
in countless ways. They ate the flowers and fruit,
wove baskets and made brushes from leaf fibers, and
made soap from the roots. Along the border, natives
still harvest the great yucca flower-heads and feed
them to livestock.</p>
<p>The Mescalero Apaches roasted the mescal or
century plant using the same technique they used for
sotol. The mescal was as central to the Apache way of
life as the bison was to the plains Indians. They made
food, drink, medicine, mats, ropes, bags, and even
needles and twine from the great, gray-green agave.</p>
<p>It is not true that the century plant takes a hundred
years to bloom; it&rsquo;s more like 25 to 50 years.
Once started the bloomstalk shoots up at the rate of
nearly 2.5 centimeters (an inch) in an hour, or up to
41 centimeters (16 inches) in 24 hours. Soon platters
of golden flowers float on the air, and bees, flies, and
ants come to the feast. The violet-throated Lucifer
hummingbird may sometimes be found at a mescal in
blooming season. At night the Mexican long tongued
bat leaves its cave on Emory Peak and comes to
feed on the nectar and ample pollen.</p>
<p>Like all agaves, the mescal expends its strength on
this onetime burst of blooming. Once the seed pods
form, the plant dies and young plants arise near its
base. But that is not the end of its beauty or its
usefulness. If you climb the foot trail to Juniper Flat
through the thickly grassed woodlands above the
Basin, you will pass more than one dead mescal with
its towering bloomstalk supported by the limbs of
some pinyon pine. Year by year, in graceful and
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
gradual decay, the agave leans in its neighbor&rsquo;s
embrace. As it slowly splits up, it dresses the pine in
a flowing drape of fiber fragments. You can see little
wormholes here and there, and larger holes where
woodpeckers have taken a meal. This life-supporting
return to dust goes on all over these mountains.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig100">
<img src="images/img042a.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="601" />
<p class="pcap">The century plant took its
name from the erroneous
notion that it took 100 years
to bloom. It takes &ldquo;only&rdquo; 25 to
50 years. Then the plant dies.</p>
</div>
<p>Many of the park&rsquo;s finest grasses may be found
in the mountains, for while the grasslands blend
into the woodlands somewhere around 1,700 meters
(5,500 feet), the grasses continue all the way up to
the mountaintops. Again, the species change with
climate, altitude, and ground cover conditions. The
beautiful bull muhly favors north-facing slopes, and,
growing in clumps up to just over a meter (4 feet)
high, it helps hold soil on the hillsides. With its large
purple flowering heads, it makes a good bedding
grass for deer. So does the golden thread-leaf stipa
that likes to grow under juniper trees, spilling its
long blades in rounded clumps.</p>
<p>Since the return of the grasses the mountains and
foothills both support a fascinating host of grassland
animals. Some, like the yellownosed cotton rat,
have come back with the grass. Many of these grassland
creatures are abroad at night and are best seen
at dawn and dusk. Even after dark you may see a
great deal of life along the highway. The 16-kilometer
(10-mile) stretch between park headquarters
and the Basin may bring startling glimpses of grassland
activity within reach of your headlights: a great
horned owl with its catlike face and &ldquo;ears,&rdquo; sitting still
as a sphinx in the middle of the road; a coyote pair
gamboling like shepherd pups, their paired eyes
flashing white and bright as automobile headlights.
These carnivores have come to hunt the rats and
rabbits making a mad dash across the road. Arthropods
and snakes come to the pavement to warm
themselves. The diamond sparkles that litter the
blacktop may be reflections from spiders&rsquo; eyes. You
see a blood-red coal of fire spring to one side at the
edge of the road and then as abruptly as a UFO leap
3 meters (10 feet) straight-up into the air. A ringtail
climbing a tree perhaps? Or a poor-will taking flight?
A flash of pink lights at elbow and shoulder height
turns out to be a mule deer and fawn. Stop, turn off
your own lights, and look and listen and you will
behold a world as it must have been a long time ago,
singing in the silence underneath the stars.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">Bandits and Revolutionaries</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>When the deepest channel of the Rio Grande became the
boundary between the United States and Mexico in
1848, the Army assumed a thankless task: To enforce an
invisible boundary in impossible terrain populated&mdash;if at
all&mdash;by people traditionally disposed to crossing the river
freely. At times the Army depended on the Texas Rangers.
During the Civil War era troops were withdrawn from
the Big Bend, and border incidents surged. After the
Mexican revolution of 1910 that government lost control
of its northern provinces. Bandit gangs plagued both
Texas and California. Pancho Villa used border forays to
create tension between Mexico and the United
States. In 1913, raiding bandit Chico Cano was captured
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
and freed by his gang in an ambush; the next year he
killed his Customs Service captor. Cano was photographed
with 8th Cavalry Major Roy J. Considine
in 1918. Three soldiers and a small boy were killed in a
1916 raid on Glenn Springs led by Navidad Alvarez, a
lieutenant of Pancho Villa. The store was looted and
houses burned. Livestock raids on ranches sometimes
left entire families murdered. Many Texas Rangers were
killed in ambush over the years. Smuggling activities
abounded. Arms and ammunitions passed into Mexico,
and liquor (during prohibition) and silver bullion passed
into the United States.</p>

Even as you begin the drive up Green Gulch you
expect to see only buffy grass, century plants, and
sotol. But as you pull abreast of Lost Mine Peak the

are covered more and more thickly with green, leafy

claw, and common bee-balm, crowned with beautiful
deciduous and evergreen leaves.</p>
<p>The Chisos Mountains fascinate for so many
reasons: their great beauty, their wooded coolness
and greenness, the exceptional variety&mdash;and rarity&mdash;of
plant and animal life. Lying close to the border,
they encompass an interesting blend of U.S. and
Mexican species. But because they stand alone and
apart, they support species found nowhere else. And
their height creates a temperate environment, a
grassed and timbered island in a sea of rock and sand.</p>
<p>In the Chisos as elsewhere in desert country, what
lives where depends on highly local conditions of
soil and climate. While daytime temperatures in the
mountains average significantly cooler than the desert
flats, and while rainfall in the Basin is twice as
heavy as at Rio Grande Village, just as crucial are the
land&rsquo;s shape and the sun&rsquo;s angle. You might expect
that trees grow as a woodland belt around the mountains,
with treeline determined by altitude. Not so.
Many trees prefer canyons to exposed slopes because
soils are deeper there and drainages offer more
water. Even in the same canyon, more trees may
grow on cooler north-facing slopes, while grasses
predominate on sunny south-facing slopes. Or pinyons,
junipers, and oaks may flourish at lower elevations,
while most other forest species occupy the
canyon&rsquo;s heights.</p>
<p>At about 1,400 meters (4,500 feet) of elevation as
the mountains begin to close, a surprise delights the
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
eye: The first of what you might call trees beside the
road. Suddenly, masses of trees&mdash;junipers, little oak
trees, and pinyon pines&mdash;higher up in the drainages
that crease the mountainside. And multitudes of
woodland birds dart in and out of the trees and
bushes along the roadway. You understand now why
they call this valley Green Gulch. As you approach
the first water tank you are in actual woodland.
Grasses still grow on the open slopes along with
bushes and pricklypear and sotol, but here are the
first easily distinguished little pinyons beside the
road. At 1,600 meters (1 mile) of elevation they are
fairly respectable pines. Tree cover increases and,
after the second water barrels, the woodland comes
right down to the road. The grass is less obvious
now, but it covers the ground between the trees and
is especially thick on south-facing slopes. Flocks of
little birds fly up from the road ahead of you. At the
switchbacks in Panther Pass you peer up the steep
slopes at solid stands of deciduous green trees set off
against darker evergreens. Way up at the top leap
scarlet flames of frost-touched Grave&rsquo;s oak and
fragrant sumac.</p>
<p>These pinyon-juniper-oak woodlands are pretty
typical of the dry Southwest. Chisos woodlands include
only one pine, three junipers, and many varieties
of oak. You can easily identify pinyon and
juniper trees, but the oaks are often hard to tell apart
because they tend to hybridize. The different tree
species have different soil and water requirements
and where moisture is harder to come by they grow
smaller and more widely spaced. You&rsquo;ll find redberry
juniper at drier, lower elevations, such as Green
Gulch. This is a rather scraggly shrub or small tree
whose lower branches often touch the ground. It has
scale-like yellow-green leaves, and red berry-like
cones. It will often invade abused grasslands. The
gray oak, an evergreen with small olive-green leaves
and dark gray bark, also prefers drier soils. On exposed
slopes it too takes on shrub-like proportions
but grows to 20 meters (65 feet) in protected canyons.
Birds, peccaries, and deer feed on gray oak acorns.
The Indians preferred the acorns of the Emory oak.</p>

<p class="pcap">Volcanic
spires remind us that change
has not always come slowly
in the Big Bend. Molten rock
under intense pressure
created these spires as plugs
inside softer rock, which has
long since eroded away.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The other narrowleaf evergreens prefer intermediate
to moister soils and the Chisos Basin is a good
place to see both drooping and alligator junipers, the
latter named for the square scales that make its bark
look like alligator hide. This slow-growing, long-lived
tree has bluish-green needles, and gray fox and
rock squirrel relish its berry-like cones. Drooping
juniper all but cries out for recognition. Its wilted
leaves and drooping branches seem to be dying of
thirst, but in fact are perfectly healthy, as is the bark
that shreds in long, fibrous strips. You&rsquo;ll find plenty
of drooping juniper in Mexico, but the only place
you can see it in the United States is right here in the
Chisos Mountains.</p>
<p>The Chisos Basin has been hollowed out of volcanic
rock by stream erosion. The peaks that ring
the Basin all came into being when molten rock
squeezed up under enormous pressure from deep
within the Earth. Some of the red hot stuff poured
out over the land surface in lava flows which cooled
so quickly that they cracked in long vertical fissures.
Then as the ages passed, joints toppled and square-faced
peaks, buttresses, and free-standing spires
emerged. So the Basin wall took shape from Casa
Grande southward through Emory Peak. Later on,
more molten rock pushed up from below, bulging
the surface rocks upward without breaking through.
Again the eons passed and the softer surface rocks
wore away, exposing the dome-shaped peaks which
now rim the Basin to the north and west. Today,
loose rocks and clays still inch downhill toward the
Window. All Basin runoff heads for this chute, and
when it storms in the heights, the dry waterfall turns
into a torrent, with boulders bouncing along like so
many corks. Growling and grumbling, the big rocks
plunge over the pouroff in a 67-meter (220-foot) free
fall, coming to Earth in a great rubble pile below.</p>
<p>Pinyon pines grow abundantly across both Mexico
and the American Southwest. In the Chisos you&rsquo;ll
find them almost anywhere above 1,500 meters
(4,800 feet) of elevation, and at lower elevations they
will be the only pines. Short of trunk, with spreading
lower branches, egg-sized cones, and short, slender,
bluish-green needles, pinyons range from dwarf size
to a tree 15 meters (50 feet) tall. Many birds and
mammals eat its delicious nuts.</p>
<p>As elevation increases you may find fewer junipers,
while more pinyons appear on the open slopes
and more oaks along drainages. The deciduous
Graves oak requires more moisture than other oaks,
so you find it putting forth its shiny, dark green
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
leaves in high moist canyons. The Emory oak also
prefers high drainages but it grows at slightly lower
elevations. It has small lance-shaped leaves. The
Chisos oak, a small, graceful tree with narrow,
leathery leaves, requires a high water table. In all the
world it grows only in the Chisos Mountains&rsquo; Blue
Creek Canyon.</p>

allowed this sub-species of whitetail to develop. These

</div>
<p>Many of these interesting woodland features can
be studied at leisure in Upper Green Gulch, reached
by the Lost Mine Trail from the trailhead in Panther
Pass, following the well-kept path at least as far as
Juniper Canyon Overlook. Here you find yourself
among the very pines and oaks that you viewed from
the switchbacks far below. On location it appears
much as it did from far below. There are few grasses
and a host of flowering bushes. Shaggy mountain-mahogany
and fragrant sumac make excellent feed
for whitetail deer. Fragrant ash puts out long clusters
of cream-colored flowers in springtime. Mountain
sage, a beautiful shrub that grows nowhere else in
the world, bursts into crimson flower each fall. As a
hummingbird feeder it even outranks the golden
platters of the century plant. Probably most surprising
at this elevation is the persistence of desert and
grassland plants, for here among the pinyon pines
and oak trees grow clumps of ocotillo, lechuguilla,
pricklypear, and the great gray-green blades and
towering bloomstalks of the Big Bend agave.</p>
<p>Dryness is a fact of life in these woodlands. The
north-facing slope is densely covered with trees,
while the opposite south-facing slope exhibits mostly
ocotillo and lechuguilla. The same holds true on
the narrow ridge extending from Casa Grande.
Pine woodlands face north and lechuguilla flourishes
on the south-facing slope. It&rsquo;s a question of
solar exposure and resulting temperature and moisture
variations.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, you will likely see more wildlife in
the populated Basin than along the whole Lost Mine
Trail, for animals find the Basin as attractive as man
does. The del Carmen whitetails find it a good place
to feed off and on throughout the day. These deer
are found only in the Big Bend and across the river
in the Sierra del Carmen. To the rock squirrels the
Basin offers acorns, pine nuts, and plenty of rocky
lodgings. The busy cactus wren can indulge its habit
of year-round nest building, because there is abundant
tall grass, and introduced yucca, a favorite
avian building site. Sounding like a child&rsquo;s squeeze
toy, the brown towhee takes to his human habitat as
freely as a house sparrow, and the crestless Mexican
jay scolds ferociously, as jays will.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">The Jackrabbit Economy</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Should the jackrabbit reflect on its situation it might think
life is a conspiracy. This prolific breeder might feel it
exists solely to keep the local web of life functioning. Many
predators include this big-eared, nimble-footed creature
in their diets.</p>
<p>Big ears, big feet, and protective coloration are the
jackrabbit&rsquo;s major survival mechanisms. It will listen for
danger, sit motionless until perceiving a threat, and then
burst into speedy flight. The ears may also represent an
adaptation through which the jackrabbit can emit excess
body heat to the environment, a useful ploy in deserts.</p>
<p>Birds, snakes, and numerous mammals prey on the jackrabbit,
which is really a hare, and on the park&rsquo;s desert cottontail
and eastern cottontail rabbits. The coyote can sustain
bursts of speed sufficient to run them down. An arch
opportunist, the coyote eats almost anything, including an
occasional tennis shoe. The bobcat and mountain lion
(photo <a href="#Page_103">page 103</a>) are the park&rsquo;s two felines. The bobcat
hunts by stealth. It will sit by a game trail for hours and
then pounce on passing prey. Threats to the jackrabbit
come from above, too, where the golden eagle soars.</p>

<p>Toward twilight the whitetail deer put in another
appearance. These dainty little animals are highly
territorial, so you are likely to see the same band of
bucks in the upper Basin, and the same doe and twin
fawns near the campground turnoff. The eastern
cottontails, larger than the desert cottontails, also
come out at dusk, after spending the day in the very
same thickets that the deer come to browse. A little
later, skunks may appear. These spotted, striped, or
hognosed nighttime foragers are cyclic in their populations,
and like the raccoon they have a decided
fondness for campgrounds.</p>
<p>In the Basin as elsewhere, many residents are
heard rather than seen, especially the tree crickets
and katydids that sing their songs at night. The
Chisos Mountains even boast their own katydid,
known nowhere else in the world, the Big Bend
quonker. Scraping its wings together it produces a
squeak much like that of a cork being pulled from a
wine bottle.</p>
<p>The woods that rim the Basin to the south have a
softer, more life-supporting look than the slopes
above Panther Pass. They feature the same junipers
and pinyon pines and the same pricklypear and
century plant, but the difference is the grass. Tall
and short, gold and blue, tasseled, tufted and feathered,
it grows so thickly under the trees and between
the shrubs that it all but covers the ground. You find
basketgrass, too, with leaf edges like fine sawteeth
and their tips frayed into curls of twine. With such
abundant cover animals should thrive, and judging
from the scat they do. In the fall the pricklypear is
still in fruit, and it appears that everyone is eating
brick-red tunas. At lower elevations where the tunas
have already gone by, many animals are eating black
persimmons.</p>
<p>But strong as the signs of life are, the evidence of
death and dying cannot be ignored. You hear the
shrieks of some creature on the edge of a little
meadow, watch a hawk come to circle the tree tops,
wonder who has won that contest as the cries cease
and the hawk flies off. You smell the pungent odor
of pine resin and follow it to its source, a pinyon
oozing crystal drops from dozens of holes. As the
sticky stuff ages it turns yellow, and there, mired in
the gum, is a small black beetle exactly as some fossil
bee in amber. And here is a redberry juniper so
strangled by pink tree-thief that the greenest thing
on it is the mistletoe cluster.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">Quicksilver Mining</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Quicksilver, or mercury, the only metal that remains liquid
at ordinary temperatures, was mined as cinnabar in the
Big Bend country from about 1884 until after World War II.</p>
<p>Cinnabar, red mercuric sulphide, was used as a pigment
and medicine as early as the first century. Indians used
it as pigment for war paints and pictographs. Today mercury
is used in electrical apparatus, control instruments,
thermometers, and medical and dental preparations. The
United States once produced about one-third of all quicksilver.
From 1910 to 1920 Texas mines produced about
one-third the U.S. production. Locally, quicksilver
mining began in 1884, but real production began after
1896. The park&rsquo;s Mariscal Mine was opened as Lindsey
Mine by D.E. Lindsey, an immigration inspector, about
1900. Production increased greatly about 1916, under the
ownership of W.K. Ellis, as World War I pushed up
quicksilver prices. The mine floundered again with postwar
price declines and was not profitable anew until
World War II. In the Mariscal Mine&rsquo;s heyday between 1919
and 1923, from 20 to 40 men worked it. All were Mexicans
except the manager, foreman, and a brick-kiln specialist.
Wood for the furnaces came from as far as 80 kilometers
(50 miles) away, by burro. These photographs
show quicksilver operations at the Waldron Mine, just
outside today&rsquo;s park, in 1916. Laborers toiled 12-hour shifts
for $1.00 then.</p>

<p class="pcap">Aplomado falcons once
ranged this far north and east,
but no longer. Now that the
national park offers a large
protected area, we hope these
birds of prey will return.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>The death of trees is actually part of the continuing
cycle of life because it returns much needed
nutrients to the soil. Termites play an important role
in converting dead wood into substances useful to
plants although they cannot digest the wood themselves.
Tiny protozoans living in their intestines
secrete digestive juices that do the job for them.
Dead trees also provide nesting and resting places
for various birds and mammals: Screech owls and
mice may make their homes in hollow trees and logs,
and so may the ringtail, gray fox, and bobcat. These
four mammals are adept tree climbers. The brush
mouse climbs to garner pine nuts, acorns and juniper
berries, while the ringtail and gray fox add berries to
supplement their largely meat diet. The bobcat, as
sure-footed aloft as other cats, will take to the trees
when pursued but prefers to hunt on the ground.</p>
<p>The bobcat, so-called because of its short tail,
limits his diet to mammals, birds, and insects. This
smallest and most common of the wild cats prefers
rocky canyons and outcrops in pine-oak woodlands.
Hunting mostly at night and on the ground, he
prowls on padded feet, hides for hours beside a game
trail, and springs on his prey in one lethal pounce.
The ringtail is the busiest of small predators. Strictly
nocturnal, he covers a wide territory several times
each night. He has much the same tastes as the
raccoon, but without the latter&rsquo;s fondness for water.
The ringtail especially likes to prowl rocky ledges
and canyon cliffs on the lookout for insects and
small rodents. He climbs easily and hunts in trees for
roosting and nesting birds.</p>
<p>Water, those rare spots where it occurs permanently,
can do astonishing things to a woodland. In a
secluded canyon you&rsquo;ll find a grotto no bigger than a
room, with countless seeps trickling down the face
of a high, nearly dry waterfall. At the foot of the fall,
maidenhair ferns and stream orchids crowd beside a
deep pool, while redbud, oaks, and maples canopy a
burbling brook. The sun rarely reaches this rock
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
garden, so that at midmorning it is significantly
cooler than the grassy slopes nearby. The water in
the main pool is even cooler. So many big boulders
lie heaped across the canyon that few animals can
reach the water, yet all sorts of creatures live here.
You&rsquo;ll find leeches in the pool, and, looking like a
shelled peapod, a dead katydid&rsquo;s exoskeleton gutted
by water insects. You&rsquo;ll hear a canyon wren echoing
its own song, and spy tiny canyon tree frogs clinging
to trees and rocks with sticky little suction-cup
mounted toes. Tiniest are the mites living in parasitic
comfort on the tree frogs. Such microenvironments
stand in surprising contrast to the grandiose
environment of the mountain masses surrounding
you here in the Chisos, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>People call one particular spot high in the Chisos
the top of the world. If you sit there at sunset you
can watch the turkey vultures describing long, lazy
figure eights from the top of the world down to the
Window and back. At that time of day those vultures,
not looking for food, simply seem to be
enjoying their world and being alive. In those sunset
cruises they&rsquo;re living to the limit of their unique life
form&mdash;and are glorifying Big Bend!</p>
<p>Big Bend&rsquo;s future, as its past, will be ruled in the
long run by triumphant nature. The vulture&rsquo;s self-celebration
almost portends this. If we are entering
another Ice Age, what a new lease on life this will be
for the high mountain forests of Douglas-fir, ponderosa
pines, Arizona cypress, and quaking aspen.
What vindication for the staying power of these
many beleaguered species. If on the other hand the
desert pushes on, the summer rains don&rsquo;t come, and
the springs dry up for good, then Big Bend&rsquo;s big trees
will vanish like the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Such events are beyond our power to influence or
foretell. Indeed, change may be so imperceptible, so
slow, that people, supposing there are people left in
Big Bend, may find it perfectly natural. Or change
may be catastrophic, and those last Big Benders
disappear without a trace, as though snatched off the
Earth. And those, if any, who come after may then
marvel over ruins and artifacts and ask what drove
these Ancients from their homes.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h3 id="c11">Approaching Big Bend</h3>
<p>Big Bend National Park sweeps so
far south that, since there is no road
through it to Mexico, the park isn&rsquo;t on
the way to anywhere. That makes an
automobile the best transportation bet.
Trains and transcontinental buses approach
only as close as Alpine and
Marathon (see <a href="#c10">map</a>). There is no public
transportation to or through the
park. You can fly into the Midland-Odessa
airport to the north. Cars may
be rented in Alpine and in the Midland
and Odessa areas. The distances encountered
are vast, so plan departures
and arrivals conveniently for available
facilities.</p>
<p>From San Antonio, Texas, it is 660
kilometers (410 miles) to the park headquarters
at Panther Junction via U.S.
90 to Marathon and south on U.S. 385.
Driving from the Persimmon Gap park
entrance to park headquarters will consume
46 of these kilometers (29 miles).
The gap is a low mountain pass once
traversed by the Comanche War Trail,
a thoroughfare northward for thousands
of horses stolen in Mexico. Had
you crossed this pass in 1859 you might
have witnessed the U.S. military experimenting
with camels as beasts of
burden for this dry country. The cantankerous
camels bettered the standard
military mule on several points.
However, the Civil War ended the
camel tryouts. The camel&rsquo;s aptness
illustrates that you are traveling desert
country. This calls for unique precautions,
so please read the &ldquo;Tips for
Desert Travelers&rdquo; on <a href="#Page_124">page 124</a>.</p>
<p>From El Paso it is 520 kilometers
(323 miles) to Panther Junction via
Interstate 10 to Van Horn, U.S. 90 to
Alpine, and south via Texas 118. You
enter the park at the Maverick entrance.
Just west of the park here on
Texas Ranch Road 170 is the ghost
town of Terlingua, a worthwhile side
trip. In the park&rsquo;s western section you
find the Painted Desert, eroded badlands
formations showing distinct bands
of colorful deposits from up to 70 million
years ago.</p>
<p>From El Paso and points west you
can take U.S. 67 south from Marfa to
Presidio, approaching the park on
Texas Ranch Road 170, the Camino
del Rio, at the Maverick entrance.
From this entrance to the headquarters
at Panther Junction is about 43
kilometers (27 miles).</p>
<p>Water and gasoline are available in
and around the park only at a few, and
often widely separated, points. Check
your water supply and gas gauge before
you leave U.S. 90.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Driving the Park.</h4>
<p>At Panther Junction
you can purchase the <i>Road Guide
to Paved and Improved Dirt Roads of
Big Bend National Park</i>. It describes
five tours and the points of interest
en route. The Santa Elena and Basin
drives begin at junctions along the
park road from Maverick to Panther
Junction. The Boquillas drive begins
at Panther Junction. The Persimmon
Gap and Maverick drives extend from
their respective entrances to Panther
Junction. A park map and information
folder includes a large map showing
major natural and historical features,
roads, and facilities and services. It is
available at Panther Junction in the
administration building, and in dispensers
at Persimmon Gap and Maverick.
(Supplies at Maverick are sometimes
exhausted.) Obtain a copy of this folder
before your trip by calling or writing
the Superintendent, Big Bend National
Park, Texas 79834, (915) 477-2251.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Primitive Roads.</h4>
<p>After you have toured
the main points on the major park
roads, you may want to see more by
vehicle. You can do so on the primitive
roads, which introduce further
varieties of scenery and interesting
plants, animals, and historic features.
Plan your trip in advance, don&rsquo;t just
turn off a main road on the spur of the
moment. And register at park headquarters,
getting current information
about road conditions from a ranger.
On these primitive roads you are on
your own, so play it safe. Primitive
roads are patrolled only infrequently.
Some are suited only for 4-wheel drive.

<h4 class="inline">Persimmon Gap Drive.</h4>
<p>This drive offers
short side trips: on a motor nature
trail up to Dagger Flat, or just off
the highway north of the Tornillo Creek
bridge to the fossil bones exhibit. Signs
along the Dagger Flat road identify
Chihuahuan Desert species, including
the giant-dagger yuccas, found in the
United States only in Big Bend country.
The Fossil Bone Exhibit shows an
extinct mammal, <i>Coryphodon</i>, whose
remains were found in sandstone deposits
about 50 million years old. Tornillo
Creek is one of the park&rsquo;s largest
drainages. The Chisos Mountains, seen
as you approach Panther Junction, are
the park&rsquo;s highest. Panther Junction is
such a focal point that you may overhear
park employees call it PJ.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Maverick Drive.</h4>
<p>Terlingua and Study
Butte are ghost towns&mdash;or nearly so&mdash;which
were once prosperous cinnabar
(mercury) mining communities. The
large, rounded Maverick Mountain
north of the road near the Maverick
entrance is the eroded exposure of an
intruded mass of molten rock pushed
up through softer, older rock beds. You
will also see the Painted Desert and
many plants of the desert shrub community.
Outside the park to the north
the Christmas Mountains are prominent.
To the east the Chisos define the
skyline. Along the Maverick drive you
come to the Santa Elena Junction,
where the Santa Elena drive begins
(see <a href="#x_SantaElenaDrive">below</a>). Further on you will see
dry washes that can carry flash floods
and gravel slopes formed by the erosion
of the mountains. Then you come
to the Basin Junction, where the Basin
drive begins (see <a href="#x_BasinDrive">below</a>). Near this
area you may also see mule deer, the
peccary (or javelina), coyote, or other
desert animals. The next stop&mdash;except
for pictures&mdash;is Panther Junction.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Boquillas Drive.</h4>
<p>From Panther Junction
you can head southeast toward the
Rio Grande&rsquo;s Boquillas Canyon. Along
the way are the Dugout Wells picnic
area and self-guiding nature trail, Hot
Springs, and Rio Grande Village (see
<a href="#c12">Facilities and Services</a>). Boquillas Canyon
is one of the Rio Grande&rsquo;s three
grandest canyons here in the park. It
was cut through the Sierra del Carmen
(<i>sierra</i> is Spanish for mountains) and
is the longest of Big Bend&rsquo;s famous
gorges. Across the river is the Mexican
village of Boquillas.</p>
<h4 class="inline"><a id="x_SantaElenaDrive">Santa Elena Drive</a>.</h4>
<p>Spectacular historic
and geologic features are found
along the Santa Elena drive. You observe
wall-like dikes, massive gravel
deposits, an ancient buried valley, and
a narrow canyon cut through volcanic
tuff. Across the river near Castolon is
the Mexican village of Santa Elena. On
the U.S. side are adobe and stone ruins
of dwellings for farms on the river
flats. Near the end of this drive a
viewpoint gives an excellent view of
Santa Elena Canyon. Summer sunlight
only strikes the canyon mouth for several
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
hours after sunrise. To take pictures,
make this trip in early morning.
The canyon is usually hot in midday
during summer.</p>
<h4 class="inline"><a id="x_BasinDrive">Basin Drive</a>.</h4>
<p>From Basin Junction
southward the Basin drive climbs out
of desert lowlands into the woodlands
of the Chisos Mountains and their
Basin, the park&rsquo;s &ldquo;island&rdquo; of green. The
grade of the approach road is deceptive:
watch that your vehicle does not
overheat. The Big Bend agave plant
reaches heights of 4 meters (15 feet).
Even if you miss its bright yellow blossoms
in summer, the old stalk remains
standing for a year or two. As you
drive up Green Gulch the vegetation
changes from desert shrub to woodland
species. The road&rsquo;s highest point
is Panther Pass, more than 1.6 kilometers
(1 mile) in elevation. At the parking
lot here the Lost Mine Trail begins
its ascent of Lost Mine Ridge, where
legends of a rich Spanish mine have
touched off many a vain (no pun intended)
search. From the top you get
superb views into Mexico. As you
leave the parking lot the road begins
to descend into the Chisos Basin via a
series of sharp curves. (Read about
the Chisos Basin under Facilities and
Services.)</p>
<h4 class="inline">Driving Safety.</h4>
<p>There are desert-related
driving hazards not mentioned
above. Please see <a href="#c17">Tips for Desert Travelers</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Facilities and Services</h3>
<p>Overnight lodging is available inside
the park at the Chisos Mountains
Lodge in the Basin; at campgrounds at
the Basin, Castolon, and Rio Grande
Village; and at a small trailer park at
Rio Grande Village.</p>
<p>Chisos Mountains Lodge accommodates
more than 200 guests in stone-and-adobe
cottages with terraces and
private baths and in modern motel-type
units. Reservations should be made by
writing to National Park Concessions,
Inc., Big Bend National Park, Texas
79834. The lodge coffeeshop serves
food from 7 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Campgrounds.</h4>
<p>Campgrounds at the
Basin, Castolon, and Rio Grande Village
provide water and comfort stations.
Electricity and fuel are not
available, except that the concessioner
sells charcoal. Ground fires are not
permitted. At Rio Grande Village only
there are pay showers and laundry facilities
for campers. Large groups may
make advance campground reservations,
but families, other small parties,
and individuals may not.</p>
<p>A number of backcountry roadside
campsites are located along the park&rsquo;s
backcountry dirt roads. A free permit,
available at any ranger station, is required.
If you are interested in a primitive
site, ask at a ranger station.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Trailer Parks.</h4>
<p>Rio Grande Village trailer
park has hookups; use of all hookups is
required. Consult a ranger before taking
trailers into the Basin campground. The
road to the Basin is not recommended
for trailers longer than 6 meters (20 feet)
or RVs (7 meters/24 feet) due to sharp
curves and steep grades.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Stores and Service Stations.</h4>
<p>Groceries,
cold drinks, camping supplies, and
film can be bought at the Basin, Rio
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
Grande Village, Castolon, and Panther
Junction. There is a gift shop in
the Chisos Mountains Lodge. Minor
auto repair service and gasoline may
be obtained at Panther Junction. Gasoline
is sold in the park at Castolon, Rio
Grande Village, and Panther Junction
only, so check your gauge before you
leave U.S. 90, and periodically in the
park.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Saddle Horses.</h4>
<p>You can arrange for
saddle horses, pack animals, and guides
in the Basin with Chisos Remuda, Basin
Rural Station, Big Bend National Park,
Texas 79834.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Naturalist Programs.</h4>
<p>Illustrated evening
talks are presented in summer at
dusk at the amphitheater in the Basin,
and in other seasons at Rio Grande
Village and park headquarters. Schedules
for all programs are listed on park
bulletin boards.</p>
<p>The naturalist programs at Big Bend
are designed to help you understand
and enjoy the natural and historic features.
The park road system features
wayside exhibits and markers about
local attractions. The Dagger Flat
Interpretive Auto Trail leaves the park
road south of Persimmon Gap. Self-guiding
trails are located at park headquarters,
Dugout Wells, Santa Elena
Canyon, the Basin, and Rio Grande
Village. A descriptive booklet is available
at the head of the Lost Mine Trail
in the Chisos Mountains, to help you
identify plants, animals, and panoramic
views.</p>
<p>Park naturalists and rangers provide
many other services to interpret the
park&rsquo;s geology, plants, animals, and
history. You can supplement these
personal services by purchasing maps
and publications at park headquarters
in Panther Junction.</p>

<h3 id="c13">Walking Trips and Hiking</h3>
<p>Besides floating the river, the surest
way to experience the &ldquo;real time&rdquo; of
the park is to walk out into it. Neither
desert nor mountains will reveal themselves
to a motor vehicle. Opportunities
for walks and hikes abound, from
short strolls on well-developed nature
trails to multi-day, cross-park treks via
its network of trails. Walks and hikes
are described in <i>Hiker&rsquo;s Guide to the
Developed Trails and Primitive Routes,
Big Bend National Park</i> (see <a href="#c19">Armchair Explorations</a>).
The guide and a &ldquo;Terlingua-Chisos
Mountains, Texas&rdquo; topographic
map sold at park headquarters
or by mail, give particulars. General
information follows.</p>
<p>If you take a trail, please stay on
it. Trails are routed for safety and
constructed to avoid washouts and
erosion. Shortcutting increases erosion
and rockslides. Low-heeled street shoes
or sneakers will suffice on developed
trails, but if you hike off trails, wear
hiking boots with thick lug soles to
protect against sharp rocks and the
spines of desert plants. Carry tweezers
in your first aid kit, for pulling spines
and thorns. Take plenty of food and
water to carry you through your return
or your connection with new supplies.
In hot weather one person needs 4
liters (1 gallon) of water per day; in
winter slightly less. In winter rattlesnakes
are rare. In summer they are
common, but are mostly abroad at
night. (See <a href="#x_PoisonousReptiles">Poisonous Reptiles</a> under
<a href="#c17">Tips for Desert Travelers</a>.)</p>
<p>Smoking is prohibited on trails, because
fire poses a real threat to plants
and animals in this dry country. Building
ground fires is prohibited, too. You
will need charcoal or a camping stove
in the campgrounds. In the backcountry
you will need a backpacking stove
and sufficient fuel for cooking and for
heating water.</p>
<p>Water is a precious resource anywhere,
but here in Big Bend it is also
scarce. Do not pollute streams, springs,
or tinajas by washing in them or close
to them. Also be careful where you
make your toilet in the backcountry.</p>
<p>Short walks on developed trails are
available throughout the park. Short
walks of 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) or less
include: Window View Trail (Chisos
Basin); Rio Grande Village Nature
Trail; Burro Mesa Pouroff Trail (Sotol
Vista/Castolon Road); Boquillas Canyon
Trail; Chisos Basin Loop Trail;
Santa Elena Canyon Trail; and Hot
Springs Canyon Overlook Trail (off
the road to Rio Grande Village).</p>
<p>Beyond the short walks, hiking and
backcountry options are endless. If
you go off trail, wear proper gear,
carry adequate supplies, use a topographic
map, and know your route.
Get advice on routes and gear from any
park ranger or at park headquarters or
any ranger station. It is important that
you inform someone, preferably a
park ranger, of your intended route. A
backcountry permit is required whenever
you plan to camp overnight anywhere
but in developed campgrounds.
Backcountry permits are issued free at
park information and orientation points
(see <a href="#c10">map</a>).</p>
<p>Take it easy on the trails and enjoy
yourself, especially until you are acclimated.
In the mountains, the elevation
adds to the exertion. In the lowlands
the heat is an important factor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h3 id="c14">Birding</h3>
<p>To learn about the raven, writes Barry
Lopez in <i>Desert Notes</i>, &ldquo;bury yourself
in the desert so that you have a commanding
view of the high basalt cliffs
where he lives. Let only your eyes protrude.
Do not blink&mdash;the movement
will alert the raven to your continued
presence ... there will be at least
one bird who will find you. He will see
your eyes staring up out of the desert
floor. The raven is cautious, but he is
thorough. He will sense your peaceful
intentions. Let him have the first word.
Be careful: he will tell you he knows
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The raven is one of more than 400
species of birds that have been seen in
Big Bend National Park. Why so many?
The park lies right smack on the flyway
for birds winging north out of
Mexico and, indeed, almost three-fourths
of the species recorded in the
park fly right on through. But for
serious birders&mdash;even those less determined
than the raven seeker Lopez describes&mdash;this
is paradise. During the
spring migration northbound birds confront
the northwest-southeast trending
Sierra del Carmen. Instead of flying
over them, most birds keep to the west
and are funneled right into the park.
For the return trip in fall, however, the
Sierra del Carmen have the opposite
effect. Many southbound birds peel off
east at Persimmon Gap. The fall migration
is smaller and brings more lowland
than mountain species.</p>
<p>The springtime bursts of birdsong
are inspired by the drive to claim
territory, as some 100 species nest
within the park. Many of these breeding
birds will abandon the lowlands as
soon as their young are big enough,
moving to the mountains to beat the
heat. Rio Grande Village, for example,
is at its low ebb for birdlife in July, and
in the Chisos Basin you will find yourself
identifying lowland birds left and
right! But all in all, Rio Grande Village,
with its ponds, cottonwood groves,
rich riverbottoms, heavy brushlands,
and neighboring desert, is the best
year-round birding site in the park. In
the springtime it offers an unbelievable
display of species.</p>
<p>The Chisos Basin is the second best
overall birding site, providing a long
parade of mountain birds throughout
the year, as well as lowland birds. The
Basin is one of three spots for the annual
Christmas Bird Count, along with
Rio Grande Village and the Castolon-Santa
Elena Canyon area. Over a five-year
period, 147 species have been
counted at these locations at Christmas
time.</p>
<p>The Colima warbler is probably the
park&rsquo;s most famous bird, because in all
the United States it nests only here in
the Chisos Mountains. It arrives in April
from southwest Mexico and leaves in
mid-September. The Big Bend has also
remained one of the few successful
breeding grounds of the peregrine falcon,
a species that suffered much from
pesticides. You are most likely to see
peregrines during their spring migration,
but nesting pairs have been sighted at
Santa Elena, Mariscal, and Boquillas
canyons and in the Chisos Mountains.
These predatory birds prefer to nest in
a scrape on a high cliff ledge. This falcon,
about the size of a crow, is slaty
backed and barred below, with a pair
of black &ldquo;mustaches&rdquo; on the face. In
its magnificent dive, the peregrine is one
of the fastest moving animals on Earth.</p>
<p>For advice on good birding spots at
any time of the year, or on where to
find specific birds, ask a ranger or at
park headquarters. Also see <a href="#c19">Armchair Explorations</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>If you stumbled onto the Rio Grande
upstream of the park, between El Paso
and Presidio, during most of the year
you&rsquo;d say &ldquo;Oh well, forget floating!&rdquo;
That stretch is most often dry, sapped
by irrigation projects. But the Rio
Grande gets a new lease on life as the
Rio Conchos, draining Mexican mountains,
flows into it at Presidio. You can
thank the Rio Conchos for the prospects
of floating the Big Bend. Along
the park boundary and down to the
Terrell-Val Verde County Line, the Rio
Grande is designated a national wild
and scenic river for 307.8 kilometers
(191.2 miles). The &ldquo;scenic&rdquo; goes without
saying. When you hit the rapids or
a cross-channel current hits you, the
&ldquo;wild&rdquo; designation rings true as well.</p>
<p>Below is general information about
floating the river. Particulars&mdash;including
descriptions of the canyons and
some rapids&mdash;are contained in, among
others, the river guide series published
by the Big Bend Natural History Association.
(See <a href="#c19">Armchair Explorations</a>.)</p>
<p>The first fact: You need a permit to
float the Rio Grande in the park, including
the Rio Grande Wild and Scenic
River. The free permit is available
from park headquarters and ranger
stations, or any park ranger. Permits
will not be issued if the river is at flood
stage. In high water the river is outright
dangerous. The annual high water
season is July through October. Flash
floods are a great danger through summer
and early fall. The best months for
river running are November through
February, when water levels are relatively
stable and the heat is moderate.
By late April or early May and after
the heat can be a problem.</p>
<p>The recommended craft is the inflatable
raft. It is not as prone to damage
from submerged rocks as are kayaks
and canoes. Any rigid craft may break
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
up when slammed into the canyon&rsquo;s
rock walls by treacherous cross-channel
currents. No craft or accessory
gear is available for rental within the
park. You must bring your own, or
make arrangements with an outfitter.
(Call or write the park for information
on local outfitting services.)</p>
<p>A second fact: Any float party, as
the name implies, should consist of
two or more people for obvious safety
reasons. Fact three: Everybody should
be able to swim....</p>
<p>You will need two vehicles, one
for put-in and one for take-out. Gear
should include: approved personal flotation
device for each person and one
extra for each boat; boat paddle for
each person; waterproof duffle; freshwater;
flashlight; lash lines and a 15-meter
(50-foot) bow line and 15-meter
(50-foot) stern line; extra paddle for
each boat; first aid kit; and boat patching
kit. Lash all these items to prevent
their loss in the event that your craft
capsizes.</p>
<p>Lest you be discouraged by the safety
warnings and logistical considerations,
suffice it to say that from the river
inside Big Bend&rsquo;s magnificent gorges
you will experience an intimate immensity
rare on this Earth.</p>
<h3 id="c16">Fishing</h3>
<p>Most of the park&rsquo;s native fish are of
minnow size but the Rio Grande does
attract anglers. The major attractions
are catfish, gizzard shad, carp and
suckers, the freshwater drum, and an
occasional longnose gar. The complete
list of fish recorded in the park and its
immediate surroundings includes 35
species, including bluegill and sunfish
species.</p>
<p>Most anglers are after the blue, channel,
and flathead catfish. The blue and
flathead are favored food fish. The
longnose gar may reach over a meter
(4 feet) in length and is predatory, as
its long snout and sharp teeth suggest.
You do not need a fishing license to
fish in the national park. For advice on
fishing spots and preferred methods,
ask a park ranger.</p>
<p>Yellow cat up to 45 kilos (100 pounds)
have been taken from the river, and
14-kilo (30-pound) cats are not uncommon.
Channel and blue cats also provide
fine sport and good eating. These
deepwater species feed on aquatic
plants, insects, and smaller fish, both
living and dead. They spawn in depressions
and sheltered nooks in river
banks and canyon cliffs. While catfish
account for most of the recreational
fishing in the Rio, many other interesting
species swim the brown waters:
the predatory garfish, needlenosed and
shaped like a torpedo; the humpbacked
carp that can survive even in limited
waters; smallmouth buffalo, sheepshead,
and green sunfish; the bullhead
that favors quiet waters and can endure
higher temperatures and lower oxygen
content than most other fish; and of
course the minnows, as plentiful and
gregarious as sparrows, with a preference
for running water and rocky or
sandy bottoms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<h3 id="c17">Tips for Desert Travelers</h3>
<h4 class="inline">Best Times to Visit Big Bend.</h4>
<p>Winter
days will be nippy in Big Bend&rsquo;s
mountains and comfortably warm in
the lowlands. Snow falls in the mountains
once or twice a year. Spring hits
the desert lowlands in February and
begins a slow ascent up the mountain
heights, arriving in May. Some of the
desert plants bloom throughout the
year, but the most predictable displays
are in springtime. Summer is problematic.
If you come in the summer
you will probably want to take to the
mountains. Midsummer daytime temperatures
in the desert and river valley
generally hover above 38&deg;C (100&deg;F)&mdash;often
well above. But up in the Basin,
daytime temperatures average 29&deg;C
(85&deg;F) and nights are cool. Autumn is
usually sunny, with the air gentle and
warm. The best months for running
the river are November through February,
both for river conditions and for
avoiding summer&rsquo;s intense heat in the
canyons.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Climbing Hazards.</h4>
<p>The character of
the basic rock in the park is very unstable,
making it unsafe for climbing.
Climbing is not recommended.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Night Driving.</h4>
<p>Be extra alert for wildlife
while you are driving at night.
Many creatures, particularly deer, may
be blinded by your headlights so that
they make no effort to get off the road.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Spines and Thorns.</h4>
<p>Beware the cactus
and other spine- and thorn-bearing
plants, shrubs, and trees. These can
inflict painful injury. To protect yourself,
wear stout shoes and tough clothing
if you go hiking off the developed
trails. If you go out at night, walk
carefully, carry a flashlight, and don&rsquo;t
venture out too far. The National Park
Service recommends that you carry
tweezers for removing irritating spines,
which may be too small to extract with
your fingers. People have even gotten
mouthfuls of delicate&mdash;but highly irritating&mdash;spines
of some pricklypear
cactus species while trying to eat the
fruits! Delicate spines hardly noticeable
to the naked eye can inflict painful
injury.</p>
<h4 class="inline"><a id="x_PoisonousReptiles">Poisonous Reptiles</a>.</h4>
<p>The park contains
copperhead snakes and four species of
rattlesnakes, although these are seldom
seen in daylight. Though poisonous,
they are protected in the park. Do
not molest or harm them. Very few
snakebites occur in the park. Most of
these involve bites to the hands of
people who have reached into places
where they couldn&rsquo;t see a snake resting
or hiding. The general precautions are
these: Stay on trails after dark and
use a flashlight, and avoid bushes and
damp areas. There are no poisonous
lizards at Big Bend, but if you molest
lizards they may bite you.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Tarantulas and Scorpions.</h4>
<p>Tarantulas,
contrary to horror films, will not bite
you unless you annoy them. And the
park species of scorpion is not deadly,
although if you are stung, get prompt
attention.</p>
<h4 class="inline">No Medical Services.</h4>
<p>There are no
doctors or nurses in the park. The
closest hospital, in Alpine, is 174 kilometers
(108 miles) from park headquarters.
Terlingua Medics, a nonprofit
first-aid station and medical care facility,
is located 42 kilometers (26 miles)
west of park headquarters, in Study
Butte. The trained paramedics can provide
interim care until further help can
be obtained in Alpine.</p>
<p>Carry your own first-aid supplies
(including tweezers). Please notify the
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
nearest park ranger or park headquarters
immediately of accidents or
emergencies.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Use Water Wisely.</h4>
<p>Carry drinking
water with you whenever you are in
desert country. This is particularly a
must when hiking: 4 liters (1 gallon)
per day per person is a good rule of
thumb. And remember: Start your return
trip <i>before</i> half of your water
supply is used up. Floaters and boaters,
do not drink the river water: Carry
your own. Any spring water used for
drinking should be treated first.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Flash Floods.</h4>
<p>High water is a threat
during the flash floods that may follow
summer thunderstorms. You must be
alert for this because a flash flood may
travel down the watershed to you even
though you were not rained on. Flash
floods make roadway dips potential
death traps. If you are caught in high
water, drive slowly to avoid stalling
your engine: Do not splash through at
a high speed. And by all means, avoid
any high water! Washouts are a hazard
in a storm and afterwards, so be on the
lookout for them. These same precautions
about high water and low spots
apply to camping, too. Do not camp in
washes and arroyos. They could turn
into swirling rivers while you sleep,
and you might not even have the warning
of raindrops to wake you.</p>
<h3 id="c18">Park Regulations</h3>
<h4 class="inline">Driving.</h4>
<p>The maximum speed on park
roads is 72 kilometers (45 miles) per
hour. Slower limits are posted; please
observe them. Do not pass or park on
curves, and take road dips slowly. Motorized
vehicles are restricted to park
roadways and are prohibited on all
trails. Check with a park ranger before
driving the primitive roads.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Trail Use.</h4>
<p>Stay on trails because shortcuts
mar the area and can cause erosion
and destructive rockslides. Smoking is
not allowed on trails because fire is a
constant hazard here. Please carry out
all your refuse.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Camping and Fires.</h4>
<p>Camping is limited
to campgrounds except for backcountry
camping, which is by permit
only. Building wood and ground fires
is prohibited.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Fishing Licenses.</h4>
<p>Fishing licenses are
not required. Obtain fishing information
from any park ranger.</p>
<h4 class="inline">Firearms and Pets.</h4>
<p>Use or display of
firearms is prohibited. Pets must be
kept on a leash at all times, and they
are not permitted on trails or in public
buildings.</p>
<h4 class="inline">River Use.</h4>
<p>A permit is required to
float the Rio Grande. At high water
float trips are particularly hazardous.
No permits are issued for Santa Elena
and Mariscal Canyons when the river
is at flood stage. Swimming in the river
is discouraged because of the dangers,
many of which are unseen. Obtain float
permits at park headquarters or ranger
stations. For information call or write
the Superintendent, Big Bend National
Park, Texas 79834, (915) 477-2251.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>
